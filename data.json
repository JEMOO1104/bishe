            "content": "To explore the mechanism of the Astragalus membranaceous (AM)-Angelica sinensis (AS) compound in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy (DN) we used network pharmacology and molecular docking. Screen the components and targets of the AM-AS compound in the TCMSP and the BATMAN-TCM, and establish a component-target interaction network by Cytoscape 3.7.2. After searching relevant targets of DN in related databases, the common targets of the AM-AS compound and DN were obtained by comparison. Gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed through David database. Molecular docking was performed by PyMoL2.3.0 and AutoDock Vina software. After screening, 142 main targets of the AM-AS compound in the treatment of DN have been identified. Target network was established and the topology of PPI network was analyzed. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis shows that these targets are related to apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, insulin resistance, etc. Molecular docking shows that the target proteins have good combinations with the main active components of the AM-AS compound. AM-AS compound may treat DN by acting on VEGFA, TP53, IL-6, TNF, MARK1, etc., and regulate apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, glucose, and lipid metabolism processes. The in vivo study results suggest that AM-AS compound can significantly reduce the FBG level of diabetic rats, increase the level of INS, improve renal functions, reduce urinary proteins, inhibit glycogen deposition, granulocyte infiltration and collagen fiber proliferation in renal tissue, and restrain the progress of DN. In vivo study combined with network pharmacology and molecular docking methods provides new ideas for the pathogenesis and treatments of DN.",

            "content": "Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatic damage is prevalent in western countries. The present study aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP), an active constituent derived from a water extract of Angelica sinensis, in rats exposed to an APAP overdose. The mechanisms underlying the activity of this compound were also considered. Specifically, serum and hepatic biochemical parameters including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were evaluated, and key proteins involved in hepatic apoptosis, including cleaved caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 were quantified. In vivo, H&E staining reveals that ASP reduces the degeneration of hepatocytes and the amount of cytoplasmic vacuolation in rats exposed to an overdose of APAP. ASP markedly alleviated liver injury via an increase in GSH levels and the inhibition of hepatic apoptosis. In vitro, ASP significantly elevated the survival rate of rat primary hepatocytes exposed to an overdose of APAP. The beneficial effect might be, at least in part, due to the amelioration of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, along with the inhibition of apoptosis. Taken together, our findings reveal that ASP has potential to be used as a hepatoprotective agent for the management of APAP-induced liver injury.",

In this study, the collagen-induced rats were administrated with Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) at 200 mg/kg (L), 400 mg/kg (M), or 800 mg/kg (H). Results showed that ASP could reduce joint swelling and significantly inhibit anti-CII-antibodies and pro-inflammatory factors in RA, H group showed the best treatment among them. Further analysis using 16S rDNA sequencing suggested that ASP could shape the gut microbiota composition. Several key bacteria, including norank_f__norank_o__Clostridia_UCG-014, Lactobacillus, norank_f__Oscillospiraceae, and norank_f__Desulfovibrionaceae, were found to be related to the development of RA. The colonic transcriptome showed that ASP could restore RA-induced intestinal dysfunction, such as tight junction disarrangement, by upregulating Cldn5. The balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts might be modified by regulating the expression of Slit3 and Rgs18 to alleviate RA, which may be correlated with gut microbiota. Our results suggested that ASP improved RA by regulating gut microbiota and gene expression, revealing a positive relationship between dietary patterns and RA.",

The positively charged nanoparticles could efficiently improve the immune responses due to targeting and activating the antigen-presenting cells. In this study, the immunopotentiator Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) was encapsulated into Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, and the polyethylenimine, one of the cationic polymers, was used to coat nanoparticles to develop a new nanoparticle delivery system (ASP-PLGA-PEI) with positively charged. The ASP-PLGA-PEI nanoparticles significantly activated macrophages, and promoted the expression of the MHCII and CD86 and the production of IL-1β and IL-12p70 cytokines of macrophages. Furthermore, the antigen adsorbed on the surface of the ASP-PLGA-PEI nanoparticles enhanced the antigen uptake by macrophages. Moreover, the mice immunized with PCV2 antigen adsorbed ASP-PLGA-PEI nanoparticles significantly enhanced PCV2-specific IgG immune response and the levels of cytokines, induced a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response with Th1 bias compared with other groups. These findings demonstrate that the positively charged nanoparticles (ASP-PLGA-PEI) have the potential to serve as an effective vaccine delivery and adjuvant system to induce vigorous and long-term immune responses.",

The results showed that sodium ferulate exhibited marked anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties by inhibiting the TNF/TNFR signal transduction pathway. On the other hand, the polysaccharidic fraction which contains a mixture of various carbohydrates was found to promote proteoglycan biosynthesis in cartilage matrix by stimulating the activity of the UDP-glycosyltransferases that synthesize the chondroitin sulfate chains of aggrecans. It is suggested that the combined action of sodium ferulate and polysaccharidic fraction would prevent cartilage destruction in osteoarthritis and favor cartilage repair.",

The current therapeutic approach of one-molecule-one-target strategy fails to address the issues of AD because of multiple pathological features of AD. Traditionally, the herb of Angelica sinensis (AS) comes from the root of an umbrella plant Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels. As a typical medicine-food herb, studies have shown that AS can alleviate AD and AD-complications by multiple targets through the various foundations of pharmaceutical material and dietary supply basis. Therefore, this review summarizes the pharmacological effects of AS for the treatment of AD and AD-complications for the first time. AS contains many effective components, such as ligustilide, z-ligustilide, n-butylidenephthalide, α-pinene, p-cymene, myrcene, ferulic acid, vanillic acid and coniferyl ferulate. It is found that AS, AS-active compounds and AS-compound recipes mainly treat AD through neuroprotective, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidant effects, improving mitochondrial dysfunction, anti-neuronal apoptosis, regulating autophagy, regulating intestinal flora and enhancing the central cholinergic system, which shows the multi-component and multi-target effect of AS. The role of dietary supplement components in AS for AD intervention is summarized, including vitamin B12, folic acid, arginine, and oleic acid, which can improve the symptoms of AD. Besides, this review focuses on the safety and toxicity evaluation of AS, which provides a basis for its application. This review will provide further support for the research on AD and the application of medicine-food herb AS in a healthy lifestyle in the future.",

Based on this, the present study investigated whether the Angelica sinensis extract, angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP), was effective to attenuate DB-induced cytotoxicity in hepatocytes. The primary hepatocytes were isolated from rats and cultured in vitro, which were subsequently treated with high-dose DB (100 μM) and ASP (12 μg/ml) to establish the DB-induced hepatotoxicity models. MTT assay and flow cytometry (FCM) were performed to evaluate cell viability, and the results showed that high-dose DB-induced cell apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation were reversed by co-treating cells with ASP, which were supported by our Western Blot assay data that ASP upregulated Cyclin D1 and CDK2 to abrogate high-dose DB-induced cell cycle arrest. In addition, ASP exerted its regulating effects on cell autophagy, and we found that ASP increased LC3B-II/I ratio and Atg5, but decreased p62 to activate the autophagy flux. Of note, the MEK/ERK pathway could be activated by ASP in the DB-treated hepatocytes, and the protective effects of ASP on high-dose DB-induced hepatocyte death were abolished by co-treating cells with the autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine, 3-MA) and MEK/ERK selective inhibitor (SCH772984). Moreover, blockage of the MEK/ERK pathway suppressed cell autophagy in the hepatocytes co-treated with ASP and high-dose DB. Taken together, this in vitro study illustrated that ASP activated the MEK/ERK pathway mediated autophagy to suppress high-dose DB-induced hepatotoxicity.",

            "content": "The promotion of liver regeneration is crucial to avoid liver failure after hepatectomy. Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) and Astragalus membranaceus polysaccharide (AMP) have been identified as being associated with hepatoprotective effects. However, their roles and specific mechanisms in liver regeneration remain to be elucidated. In the present study, it suggested that the respective use of ASP or AMP strikingly promoted hepatocyte proliferation in vitro with a wide range of concentrations (from 12.5 μg/mL to 3200 μg/mL), and a stronger promoting effect was observed in combined interventions. A significantly enhanced liver/body weight ratio (4.20%) on day 7 and reduced serum transaminase (ALT 243.53 IU/L and AST 423.74 IU/L) and total bilirubin (52.61 IU/L) levels on day 3 were achieved by means of ASP-AMP administration after partial hepatectomy in mice. Metabonomics showed that differential metabolites were enriched in glycolysis with high expression of beta-d-fructose 6-phosphate and lactate, followed by significantly strengthened lactate secretion in the supernatant (0.54) and serum (0.43) normalized to control. Upon ASP-AMP treatment, the knockdown of hexokinase 2 (HK2) or inhibited glycolysis caused by 2-deoxy-d-glucose decreased hepatocyte proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, pathway analysis predicted the role of JAK2/STAT3 pathway in ASP-AMP-regulated liver regeneration, and phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 was proven to be elevated in this promoting process. Finally, downregulated expression of HK2, an attenuated level of lactate secretion, and reduced hepatocyte proliferation were displayed when STAT3 was knocked out in vitro. Therefore, it can be concluded that ASP-AMP accelerated liver regeneration and exerted a hepatoprotective effect after hepatectomy, in which the JAK2/STAT3/HK2 pathway was actively involved in activating glycolysis.",

This paper systematically studied the morphological structure, thousand seed weight, viability, storage and other basic biological characteristics of wild A. sinensis fruits and seeds, and focused on the germination of excised embryos,the development of embryo, the effects of the temperature,light and hormones on seed germination.The study found that:①The embryos are not fully developed when harvested, the initial germination rate was low, the embryos can develop. After 15 days of low temperature storage, the embryos can develop completely and the germination rate is significantly increased. These results show that wild A. sinensis seeds have no dormancy, and the low germination rate is due to the low maturity of wild A. sinensis seeds. ②The sui-table germination temperature of wild A. sinensis is 15-25 ℃,and the optimal temperature is 20 ℃. Light does not affect the germination of A. sinensis seeds.③The applicable concentration of GA_3 can promote seeds germination, IAA and 6-BA has no significant effect on germination.④The optimum storage condition is dry storage at 4 ℃. Wild A. sinensis seeds can be stored for 1.5 years and cultivated seeds can be stored for 1 year.During the introduction and conservation, the best treatment conditions were dry storage at 4 ℃ for 30 d and soaking seeds with 200 mg·L~(-1) GA_3, the germination rate can reach 86.7%.",

However, its role and mechanism in chronic liver fibrosis have not been fully elucidated. In this study, a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced chronic liver fibrosis mouse model was established. The results showed that ASP treatment reduced serum alanine aminotransferase by approximately 50% and liver fibrosis areas by approximately 70%. Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation was inhibited in ASP-treated mice. Furthermore, the mechanism was studied in-depth, focusing on the interleukin 22/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (IL-22/STAT3) axis. Concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml ASP induced the secretion of IL-22 in vitro, which further increased at a concentration of 200 μg/ml. Moreover, in vivo data showed that ASP significantly promoted IL-22 production in splenocytes and liver tissues. The antifibrotic effects of ASP were abolished after IL-22 neutralization. In addition, ASP activated the STAT3 pathway in the liver, as demonstrated by a 2-fold increase compared to that of the CCl4 group, which was abrogated by the IL-22 antibody. Subsequently, we showed that the antifibrotic effects of ASP were abrogated by blocking STAT3 with S3I-201. In conclusion, ASP effectively alleviates chronic liver fibrosis by inhibiting HSC activation through the IL-22/STAT3 pathway.",

            "content": "Preovulatory follicles need a network of blood vessels to growth and maturation in hens (Gallus gallus). Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) (AS), a traditional Chinese herb, displays a novel pro-angiogenic activity. The molecular mechanisms underlying AS promoting preovulatory follicles angiogenesis are poorly understand. Several recent studies investigated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in angiogenesis. In order to explore the promotion effect of AS extract on angiogenesis of chicken preovulatory follicles, we studied the effect of AS extract on follicle microvascular endothelial-like cells of chicken (FMEC) and granulosa cells (GC). The current study indicated that AS extract could promote the proliferation of FMECs and GCs. The assays of wounding healing, transwell invasion and tube formation showed that AS extract could enhance the invasion and migration ability of FMECs in vitro. The results of western blot and RT-PCR showed that AS extract promoted the phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in FMECs by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The AS extract activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and up-regulated the expressions of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1-α) and VEGF-A in GCs. In addition, treatment of FMECs and GCs with LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) significantly down-regulated the phosphorylation of VEGFR2, VEGF-A, and HIF1-α. The mRNA expression levels of PI3K, AKT, VEGF-A, VEGFR2, and HIF1-α were consistent with protein expression levels. In conclusion, our research showed that AS extract can promote the follicle angiogenesis in hens in vitro, providing a basis for application of the traditional Chinese herb AS in poultry production.",

In vivo and in vitro models of alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) were established to examine the direct effect of ASP on hepatic fat accumulation. Our results showed that the lipid-lowering effect of ASP might result from the dual inhibition of lipid synthesis and CD36-mediated lipid uptake. The antioxidation of ASP might be attributed to the reversal of alcohol metabolic pathways from CYP2E1 catalysis to ADH catalysis. Taken together, the study demonstrated the direct role of ASP in lipid metabolism for the first time and revealed the underlying mechanism of reducing ROS, providing an available strategy for ASP as a potential agent to treat AFLD.",

In vitro the Cck-8 assays showed that Angelica sinensis had weak antiproliferative effect on A549 cells only at high concentration. The cell adhesion assay showed that Angelica sinensis decreased the adhesive ability of A549 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Transwell invasion and migration assay showed that Angelica sinensis reduced the invasive and migratory abilities of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo the animal experiments showed that Angelica sinensis suppressed lung metastasis of nude mice at high concentration. Then, we attempted to clarify the mechanisms of anti-metastatic activities of Angelica sinensis. The results showed Angelica sinensis inhibited the enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), it involved the down-regulation of the expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 at both the protein and mRNA levels, which may be associated with Angelica sinensis suppressing the expression of TGF-β1. It also involved the increase of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases TIMP-2, but TIMP-1 decreased upon incubation of A549 cells with Angelica sinensis. The results suggest that Angelica sinensis might exert anti-growth and anti-metastasis activity against lung cancer cells through the decrease of MMP-2, MMP-9, TGF-β1 and TIMP-1 and increase of TIMP-2.",

            "content": "The genus Angelica encompasses 80 species worldwide. Among them, only Angelica sinensis is widely used in China and Japan. To explore the quality and geographical distribution of A. sinensis, we collected 1,530 plants from Gansu Province and analyzed them for their contents of chlorogenic acid (CA), ferulic acid (FA), senkyunolide I(SI), senkyunolide A(SA), senkyunolide H (SH), coniferyl ferulate (CF), ligustilide (LI), and butenyl phthalide (BP) using UPLC. We also assessed the relationship between the ecological environment and quality of A. sinensis through maximum entropy modeling and a geographical information system. The habitat suitability distribution demonstrated that the most influential ecological factors for the growth of A. sinensis were altitude, precipitation during March, May, and December, precipitation during the wettest month, and the soil pH. The most suitable areas for cultivation are concentrated to the south of Gansu Province, including Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Dingxi City, Tianshui City, south of Wuwei City, east of Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, north of Longnan City, and northwest of Pingliang City. The quality suitability regionalization analysis divulged that the most influential ecological factors for the index components of A. sinensis were the altitude, sunshine, rainfall, temperature, and soil pH. The highest quality A. sinensis grow in Dingxi City, Tangchang, Lixian, and Wen counties in Longnan City, Wushan County in Tianshui City, Lintan, Zhouqu, and Zhuoni counties in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Kangle and Linxia counties in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture. The experiment yielded highly accurate results (accuracy of 0.955), suggesting that the results were consistent with the actual distribution of A. sinensis in Gansu. The inferences of this research will naturally draw the attention of the authorities in the fields of natural resources and agriculture departments and provide a scientific basis for the rational selection of A. sinensis cultivation areas.",

Concentrations of ASP ranging from 5 to 125 μg/mL could inhibit concanavalin A (ConA)-induced lymphoproliferative response. The potential hepatoprotective activity of ASP was demonstrated by the significant decrease in serum transaminase (ALT and AST) levels and the attenuation of liver inflammation damage exhibited by H&E stain of the liver. Furthermore, ASP pretreatment significantly decreased proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-6) and alleviated oxidative stress by reducing MDA and ROS levels and by enhancing SOD activity after ConA administration in mice. Results of Western blot analysis indicated that ASP attenuated Caspase-3-dependent apoptosis by Caspase-8 and JNK-mediated pathway and inhibited the activation of IL-6/STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathways in ConA-induced liver damage in mice. In conclusion, ASP pretreatment could attenuate concanavalin A-induced liver injury through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant actions in mice.",

The in vitro assay revealed significant inhibition of crystal formation (6.99 ± 1.07) in the group treated with 4.0 mg/mL Angelica sinensis polysaccharide extract compared with the control group (58.38 ± 5.63; p < .05). In vivo, after treatment with ethylene glycol for 28 days, urinary oxidative stress, oxalate, creatinine, urea and urolithiasis-related protein were significantly increased (p < .05), except for serum oxidative stress (p > .05). The rats administered the extract of Angelica sinensis polysaccharide showed significantly decreased pathological change and CaOx deposition (p < .05) compared with the urolithiatic rats. Significantly reduced levels of urinary oxidative stress, oxalate, creatinine, urea and urolithiasis-related protein were observed in the Angelica sinensis polysaccharide treatment groups (p < .05) compared with the nephrolithic rats.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The results presented here suggest that Angelica sinensis polysaccharide has the potential to inhibit CaOx crystallization in vitro and may present anti-urolithiatic effects in vivo.",

            "content": "Oxidative stress-induced dysfunction of nerve cells has been implicated as a crucial cause of cell death in neurodegenerative diseases. In Asian countries, herbs, such as Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (DG) and Rehmannia glutinosa (Gaertn.) DC. (SDH), have long be considered to have antiaging abilities. The herbs act as neuro protectants that rescue nerve cells from oxidative stress damage and apoptosis. Thus, developing herbal formulas can potentially lead to new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we compared the effective active components and antioxidant properties of extractive of DG and SDH (DG-SDH) when formulated at different ratios. DG-SDH formulated at a ratio of 3:2 (DG-SDH [3:2]) produced the highest content of polysaccharides, polyphenols, and flavonoids. It also showed the best ability in removing DPPH and hydroxyl free radicals compared to single herb or other compounding ratio. The antioxidant activity of DG-SDH (3:2) showed best synergistic effects in scavenging activity assays of DPPH free radicals and hydroxyl free radicals. DG-SDH (3:2) could increase the cell viability of SHSY-5Y cells, PC-12 cells, and BV-2 cells. In particular, DG-SDH (3:2) protected SHSY-5Y cells from H2 O2 -induced cell injury by inhibiting excessive expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing the rate of apoptosis and restoring mitochondrial membrane potential. Actin-Tracker Green and DAPI staining and fluorescence microscope observation confirmed that DG-SDH (3:2) helped in preserving cell morphology under oxidative stress. These findings support that DG-SDH (3:2) promote the neuroprotection against hydrogen peroxide and can serve as a novel therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This is the first study to investigate DG and SDH interaction between effective ingredients. These findings support that DG-SDH (3:2) has the best synergistic effects in antioxidant activity and promote the neuroprotection against hydrogen peroxide. Hence, DG-SDH (3:2) will be an excellent candidate to be developed as a functional food ingredients or nutraceuticals for neurodegenerative diseases.",

This experimental study was based on ear edema model caused by 12-O-tetracycline-propylphenol-13-acetic acid (TPA) in mice and compared with the Ibuprofen (Ib) group. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyse the composition of the essential oils from the four studied Umbelliferae plants (Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, A. dahurica (Hoffm.) Benth. & Hook.f. ex Franch. & Sav., A. pubescens Maxim and Foeniculum vulgare Mill.). Biologically active components in volatile oils from the four studied Umbelliferae plants were evaluated. The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and RelA (p65) in mouse skin were determined by immunohistochemical method. The refractive index of the four essential oils was calculated. A total of 239 compounds were identified by GC-MS from the four studied plants, and the main constituents were osthole (44.61%, APEOs), obepin (0.59%, APEOs & 86.58%, FVEOs), undecanol (8.58%, ADEOs), α-muurolene (7.95%, ADEOs) and cis-anethol (9.11%, ADEOs).

This study showed that all the essential oils from the four studied Umbelliferae plants contained various lactones, including ligustrongolactone, trans-anisol and imperatorin. According to the results of the TPA induction test in the mouse ear edema model, the essential oils of four Umbelliferae plants reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, COX-2, IL-6 and p65. All of them showed extraordinary biological activity in anti-inflammatory, so they have potential application value for biomedical products, pharmaceutical preparations, natural functional nutrients and cosmetic additives.",

Then 2 × 106 lymph node cells from DBA/2 donor mice were transplanted within 4 h after radiation. The mice in the various groups were fed saline or ASP for 2 weeks. For the in vitro experiment, bone marrow nucleated cells (BMNCs) and Treg cells were sorted from the mice on the 2nd day of modeling, and then cultured with or without ASP.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The mice treated with the medium dose of ASP for 14 days showed increased white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), platelet (PLT), BMNC counts and Lin-Sca-1 + c-Kit+ (LSK) populations viability compared with the mice in the AA group mice. The data showed that ASP decreased damage to the mitochondrial outer membrane, improved the stabilization of the mitochondrial membrane, and corrected the abnormal levels of ROS and mitochondrial-associated apoptosis proteins, including the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression, in BMNCs which were sorted from the bone marrow cells of AA mice. The changes to the p-P38/P38 and Treg/Th17 ratios induced by AA were also reversed by the medium dose of ASP.

Secondary metabolites and carbohydrates have been demonstrated to be the two major kinds of bioactive components of Danggui. However, previously, quality comparison between ASR and AAR intensively concerned secondary metabolites but largely overlooked carbohydrates, thus failing to include or take into consideration an important aspect of the holistic quality of Danggui. In this study, untargeted/targeted metabolomics and glycomics were integrated by multiple chromatography-based analytical techniques for qualitative and quantitative characterization of secondary metabolites and carbohydrates in Danggui so as to comprehensively evaluate and compare the quality of ASR and AAR. The results revealed that not only secondary metabolites but also carbohydrates in ASR and AAR were different in type and amount, which should collectively contribute to their quality difference. By providing more comprehensive chemical information, the research results highlighted the need to assess characteristics of both carbohydrates and secondary metabolites for overall quality evaluation and comparison of ASR and AAR.",

Female ginseng (Angelica sinensis) is a renowned herb with abundant coumarins, originated in China and known for the treatment of female ailments for thousands of years. The molecular basis of simple coumarin biosynthesis in A. sinensis and the evolutionary history of the genes involved in furanocoumarin biosynthesis are largely unknown. Here, we generated the first chromosome-scale genome of A. sinensis. It has a genome size of 2.37 Gb, which was generated by combining PacBio and Hi-C sequencing technologies. The genome was predicted to contain 43 202 protein-coding genes dispersed mainly on 11 pseudochromosomes. We not only provided evidence for whole-genome duplication (WGD) specifically occurring in the Apioideae subfamily, but also demonstrated the vital role of tandem duplication for phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in A. sinensis. Combined analyses of transcriptomic and metabolomic data revealed key genes and candidate transcription factors regulating simple coumarin biosynthesis. Furthermore, phylogenomic synteny network analyses suggested prenyltransferase genes involved in furanocoumarin biosynthesis evolved independently in the Moraceae, Fabaceae, Rutaceae and Apiaceae after ζ and ε WGD. Our work sheds light on coumarin biosynthesis, and provides a benchmark for accelerating genetic research and molecular breeding in A. sinensis.",

Furthermore, ASP-PLGA-PEI nanoparticles increased the levels of pJAK2 protein, and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines induced by ASP-PLGA-PEI nanoparticles were decreased with the presence of the inhibitor of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. In addition, the nanoparticles were internalized by DCs mainly through the clathrin-mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis.

            "content": "Aging is an inevitable physiological process associated with an imbalance in the oxidative defense system. Angelica sinensis, a kind of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has anti-oxidant effects and has been considered as a potential supplement in anti-aging treatment. Nevertheless, it has the disadvantages of slow efficacy and long duration of treatment. Fermentation, as an efficient biotechnological approach, is beneficial for improving the nutritional capacity of the material. Fermented TCMs are considered to be more effective. In this study, fermented Angelica sinensis (FAS) and non-fermented Angelica sinensis (NFAS) were used to investigate changes in the chemical constituents. Furthermore, the improvement effect of FAS on D-galactose-induced aging in mice and the potential mechanisms were explored. The results revealed that FAS and NFAS had different constituents under the influence of fermentation, such as 3-phenyllactic acid, L-5-hydroxytryptophan, taxifolin and methyl gallate. These elevated constituents of FAS might help increase the ability of FAS to improve aging. The aging model was established by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose (2.5 g kg-1 day-1) for 44 days, and FAS (3 g kg-1 day-1) was administered daily by oral gavage after 2 weeks of induction with D-galactose. FAS was observed to significantly ameliorate changes associated with liver aging, such as reduction of MDA, AGEs and 8-OHdG. The contents of pro-inflammatory cytokines containing TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were significantly suppressed in the FAS group. In addition, FAS activated Nrf2 signaling better than NFAS, improved the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, GCLC, GCLM and GSS, and further increased the activities of SOD, CAT and other antioxidant enzymes in the liver. Simultaneously, it had a certain repair effect on the liver tissues of mice. The intestinal microbiota analysis showed that FAS could regulate the microbiota imbalance caused by aging, increase the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes by 95% and improve the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria related to Nrf2 signaling, such as Lactobacillus. Besides, fecal metabolite analysis identified uric acid as an evidential metabolite, suggesting that FAS participates in purine metabolism to improve aging. Therefore, the regulation of intestinal microbiota and metabolism may be one of the important mechanisms of FAS in alleviating hepatic oxidative stress via the gut-liver axis. The results of this study could provide information for the future development of postbiotic products that may have beneficial effects on the prevention or treatment of aging.",

            "content": "In recent years, the utilization of polysaccharides as targeted drug carriers has attracted considerable attention. Herein, Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP), a plant polysaccharide with good biocompatibility, excellent aqueous solubility and intrinsic liver-targeted capability, was modified with hydrophobic group (deoxycholic acid) to fabricate amphiphilic conjugate (ASP-DOCA). Self-assembled nanoparticles were successfully developed for hepatoma-targeted delivery of therapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX). The DOX loaded nanoparticles (DOX/ASP-DOCA NPs) were spherical in shape with a particle size of 228 nm and negatively charged around -17 mV. DOX was released from nanoparticles in a sustainable and pH-dependent manner. In vitro cellular uptake revealed that DOX/ASP-DOCA NPs were internalized into HepG2 cells through asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR)-mediated endocytosis, resulting in a higher anti-proliferation effect than DOX-loaded dextran derivative DOX/DEX-DOCA NPs. Additionally, DOX/ASP-DOCA NPs showed higher inhibition on the growth of HepG2 multicellular spheroids (MCs) than DOX/DEX-DOCA NPs. In vivo imaging demonstrated that ASP-DOCA NPs specifically targeted HepG2 tumors via ASGPR, improving the accumulation of DOX/ASP-DOCA NPs in tumors and generating superior antitumor activity compared with free DOX and DOX/DEX-DOCA NPs. Taken together, ASP-DOCA NPs possess potential applications in drug delivery systems targeting liver cancer.",

Moreover, inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a were decreased strikingly in CFA-induced arthritic rats after treatment of ASP. Evidence also showed that ASP strongly inhibited hepcidin expression through the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK2/STAT3) pathway. Furthermore, ASP exhibited reduced primary and secondary lesions in adjuvant arthritis, attenuating synovitis and inflammatory joint damage. Data presented in this article collectively indicated that ASP significantly decreased proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-6), which might play a crucial role in the CFA-induced arthritic rats, and had a therapeutic effect on adjuvant arthritis in rats. Results of Western blot analysis indicated that ASP inhibited the activation of IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in the CFA-induced arthritic rats.",

Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed, and apoptosis-related proteins including Bcl-2 and Bax were detected. Autophagy levels were evaluated by light chain 3 (LC3) II immunofluorescence staining, mRFP-GFP-LC3 fluorescence localization, and western blot (LC3II, p62, Beclin-1, Atg5). Meanwhile, activation of the ERK 1/2 pathway was determined by western blot.

APS-1I is a 17.0 kDa heteropolysaccharide, whose backbone is composed of α-1,6-Glcp, α-1,3,6-Glcp, α-1,2-Glcp, α-1,4-Galp, and α-1,3-Rhap, and whose two branches contain α-1,3,5-Araf, α-1,3-Araf, α-1,4-Galp, β-1,3-Galp, and β-1,4-Glcp. APS-2II is a 10.0 kDa linear glucan, that contains α-1,6-Glcp, α-1,3-Glcp, α-1,2-Glcp, and α-T-Glcp. In vitro, APS-1I demonstrated better promotion on glucose absorption and stronger repression on p-IRS-1 (Ser307), p-IRS-2 (Ser731), p-JNK, and p-P38 than APS-2II in insulin resistance (IR)-HepG2 cells. Furthermore, APS-1I treatment couldn't further decrease the inhibition on the phosphorylation of JNK and P38 produced by RAGE siRNA in IR-HepG2 cells. In vivo, APS-1I markedly improved IR and reversed the livers RAGE-JNK/p38-IRS signaling in high-fat-diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, suggesting that APS-1I could be a potential agent for improving IR in type 2 diabetes.",

This traditional Chinese medicine has been used for thousands of years for treating gynecological diseases and used in functional foods for the prevention and treatment of various diseases, such as inflammation and cancer. The antitumor activity of ASP is related to its biological activities, because it suppresses a variety of pro-proliferative or anti-apoptotic factors that are dramatically expressed in cancer cells of given types. In this study, we show that angelica sinensis polysaccharide induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells of T47D over-expressing the Cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB), inducing apoptosis-related signaling pathway activity. The result also found that ASP caused cell death was linked to caspase activity, accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and Bax translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria. We found that ASP significantly affected the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), Bcl-2 Associated X Protein (Bax), Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and apoptotic protease activating facter-1 (Apaf1) protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. DAPI staining and Flow cytometry were used to analyze apoptosis. The nude mice xenograft model was used to evaluate the antitumor effect of ASP in vivo. ASP has profound antitumor effect on T47D cells, probably by inducing apoptosis through CREB signaling pathway. Thus, these results suggest that ASP would be a promising therapeutic agent for breast cancer.",

Pharmacological studies indicate that DBT has estrogenic, erythropoietic and osteogenic properties; however, the action mechanism for this complex herbal decoction is not known. Calycosin, a major flavonoid in AR, shares similar structure with β-estradiol, and thus which is hypothesized to be the critical compound of DBT. Here, we aim to investigate the role of calycosin in DBT in terms of its biological functions by using a calycosin-depleted DBT decoction (DBT(Δcal)). The biological functions of DBT(Δcal) and parental DBT were systematically compared.,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      In order to standardize DBT decoction, four chemical markers were determined and quantified by HPLC. A semi-preparative HPLC method was utilized to prepare DBT(Δcal). The authenticity of DBT(Δcal) was evaluated by LC-QQQ-MS/MS. To reveal the effect of calycosin on DBT functions, several cell assays related to the known properties of DBT were revealed, including estrogenic, erythropoietic and osteogenic functions.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      As compared to parental DBT, the estrogenic, erythropoietic and osteogenic abilities were markedly reduced in DBT(Δcal).

Traditional modalities with most used radiation and chemotherapy are nonspecific and toxic which cause adverse effects on normal cells. Differentiation inducing therapy forcing malignant cells to undergo terminal differentiation has been proven to be a promising strategy. However, there is still scarce of potent differentiation inducing agents. We show here that Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP), a major active component in Dong quai (Chinese Angelica sinensis), has potential differentiation inducing activity in human chronic erythro- megakaryoblastic leukemia K562 cells. MTT assays and flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that ASP inhibited K562 cell proliferation and arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. ASP also triggered K562 cells to undergo erythroid differentiaton as revealed by morphological changes, intensive benzidine staining and hemoglobin colorimetric reaction, as well as increased expression of glycophorin A (GPA) protein. ASP induced redistribution of STAT5 protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Western blotting analysis further identified that ASP markedly sensitized K562 cells to exogenous erythropoietin (EPO) by activating EPO-induced JAK2/ STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation, thus augmenting the EPO-mediated JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway. On the basis of these findings, we propose that ASP might be developed as a potential candidate for chronic myelogenous leukemia inducing differentiation treatment.",

Hence, a series of novel hepatoprotective, biocompatible, antibacterial silver nanoformulations (AS-AgNPs) were developed by using the important Chinese medicinal plant Angelica sinensis. The different size of AS-AgNPs were characterized by UV-Visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The size-dependent antibacterial properties of AS-AgNPs were investigated against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and multi-drug resistant bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of AS-AgNPs with different size against six bacteria was found to be in the range of 5-100 μg mL-1 with no resistance till 12 cycles. TEM and SEM results of bacteria after the treatment suggested that AS-AgNPs disrupted the cell membrane by creating pores. The cytocompatibility and cytoprotective effect of AS-AgNPs were evaluated against HepG2 cell lines, which showed that 85% of cells were viable up to 100 μg mL-1 of the concentration with almost no change in AST and ALT levels. Further, a logic combinatorial library, including basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOR, INHIBIT, IMPLICATION, and YES), three input logic gates (OR, and NOR) and combinatorial gates (INH-OR, INH-YES, INH-INH, AND-NOR, and NOT-AND-NOR) were designed by integrating multi-components based on the interaction between AS-AgNP1 and bacteria, where DiSC3(5) was used as the signal reporter.

We investigated whether AS induces hypertrophy in myotubes through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (also termed PKB)/mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      An in vitro experiment investigating the induction of hypertrophy in myotubes was conducted. To investigate whether AS promoted the hypertrophy of myotubes, an established in vitro model of myotube hypertrophy with and without AS was used and examined using microscopic images. The role of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in AS-induced myotube hypertrophy was evaluated. Two inhibitors, wortmannin (an inhibitor of PI3K) and rapamycin (an inhibitor of mTOR), were used.,Result:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The results revealed that the myotube diameters in the AS-treated group were significantly larger than those in the untreated control group (P < 0.05). Wortmannin and rapamycin inhibited AS-induced hypertrophy. Furthermore, AS increased Akt and mTOR phosphorylation through the PI3K pathway and induced myotube hypertrophy.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The results confirmed that AS induces hypertrophy in myotubes through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.",

            "content": "Neuroblastoma is the most common tumor diagnosed in children and infants, with high recurrence and poor prognosis. Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (AP) whose average molecular weight is 72,900 Da possesses various bioactivities. We aimed to explore the effects of AP on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells as well as the underlying mechanisms. Effects of AP on cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and expressions of long noncoding RNA H19 (lncRNA-H19), microRNA (miR)-675, and CD44 were assessed. Then, effects of miR-675 overexpression on AP-treated cells were analyzed. Next, expression of key kinases in the PI3K/AKT and JAK/ STAT pathways was detected. The possible target gene of miR-675 was finally explored. Cell viability was reduced by 200-500 µg/mL AP. Meanwhile, AP repressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, but induced apoptosis. Expressions of lncRNA-H19 and miR-675 were upregulated in neuroblastoma cells, and were downregulated by AP. AP was also identified to upregulate CD44. We next found AP affected SH-SY5Y cells through downregulating miR-675. Key kinases in the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways were downregulated by AP stimulation, while these downregulations were abrogated by miR-675 overexpression. KIF1B isoform β (KIF1Bβ) is proved to be a target of miR-675. In conclusion, AP was first identified to inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion but induce apoptosis. Furthermore, AP might repress tumorigenesis of SH-SY5Y cells through miR-675-mediated inactivation of the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways. Besides, KIF1Bβ might be a target of miR-675.",

            "content": "The study indicates inflammation and autophagy are closely related to neural apoptosis in the pathology of ischemic stroke. In the study, we investigate the effects and mechanisms of the extracts of Angelica sinensis and Cinnamomum cassia (AC) from oriental medicinal foods on inflammatory and autophagic pathways in rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Three doses of AC extract were, respectively, administered for 7 days. It suggests that AC extract treatment ameliorated scores of motor and sensory functions and ratio of glucose utilization in thalamic lesions in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of Iba1 was decreased and CD206 was increased by immunofluorescence staining, western blotting results showed expressions of TLR4, phosphorylated-IKKβ and IκBα, nuclear P65, NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 were downregulated, and Beclin 1 and LC3 II were upregulated. Low concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were presented by ELISA assay. Additionally, caspase 8 and cleaved caspase-3 expressions and the number of TUNEL positive cells in ipsilateral hemisphere were decreased, while the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax was increased. Simultaneously, in LPS-induced BV2 cells, it showed nuclear P65 translocation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines were suppressed by AC extract-contained cerebrospinal fluid, and its intervened effects were similar to TLR4 siRNA treatment. Our study demonstrates that AC extract treatment attenuates inflammatory response and elevates autophagy against neural apoptosis, which contributes to the improvement of neurological function poststroke. Therefore, AC extract may be a novel neuroprotective agent by regulation of inflammatory and autophagic pathways for ischemic stroke treatment.",

The MS data were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) to rapidly find the potential characteristic components of RAS from top-geoherb region and non top-geoherb region. Totally, fifty-one volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were identified, in which β-ocimene, α-pinene, 3-methylbutanal, heptanes, butanal were identified as potential markers for distinguishing RAS from top-geoherb region and non top-geoherb region. Sulphur dioxide was detected in some commercial RAS samples, which implied that sulphur-fumigation might be the main reason for the quality inconsistencies of commercial RAS samples. These results suggested that RAS from top-geoherb region and non-top geoherb region could be discriminated by the method. And characteristic chemical markers found in current study can be used for ensuring consistent quality of top-geoherb of RAS.",

Although AS has been shown to ameliorate cognitive damage and nerve toxicity in D-galactose (D-gal)-elicited senescent mice brain, its effects on liver and kidney injury have not yet been explored. In this work, mice were subjected to hypodermic injection with D-gal (200 mg/kg) and orally gavaged with AS (20, 40, or 80 mg/kg) once a day for 8 successive weeks. Results revealed that AS significantly improved liver and kidney function as assessed by organ index and functional parameters. In addition, AS pretreatment effectively ameliorated the histological deterioration. AS attenuated the MDA level and markedly enhanced the activities and gene expressions of antioxidative enzymes, namely Cu, Zn-SOD, CAT, and GPx. Furthermore, AS markedly inhibited the D-gal-mediated increment of expressions of inflammatory cytokines iNOS, COX-2, IκBα, p-IκBα, and p65 and promoted the IκBα expression level in both hepatic and renal tissues. In sum, AS pretreatment could effectively guard the liver and kidney of mice from D-gal-induced injury, and the underlying mechanism was deemed to be intimately related to attenuating oxidative response and inflammatory stress.",

            "content": "Botanical resources with great diversity in medicinal and aromatic plants are a rich and reliable source for finding insect repellents of plant origin, which are widely popular among today's consumers. Although some herbal-based repellents have been proven comparable to or even better than synthetics, commercially available natural repellents generally tend to be expensive, with short-lived effectiveness. This critical flaw leads to ongoing research for new and effective repellents, which provide longer protection against vector and nuisance-biting insects, while remaining safe, user friendly, and reasonably priced. This study aimed to evaluate the repellent activity of plant-derived products against the primary dengue vector, Aedes aegypti, by following the human bait technique of World Health Organization guidelines. Preliminary laboratory screening tests for repellency of 33 plant species clearly demonstrated Angelica sinensis as the most effective repellent from each kind of extracted product, with its essential oil and ethanolic extract having median complete protection times of 7.0 h (6.0-7.5) and 2.5 h (2.0-2.5), respectively. Due to its low yield (0.02 %), pungent smell, and little cause of irritation, A. sinensis essential oil did not qualify as a candidate for further repellent assessment. However, subsequent extractions of A. sinensis with different organic solvents of increasing polarity provided four extractants with varying degrees of repellency against A. aegypti. The hexane extract of A. sinensis provided excellent repellency, with a median complete protection time of 7.5 h (6.5-8.5), which was longer than that of ethanol (2.5, 2.0-2.5 h), acetone (1.75, 0.5-2.5 h), and methanol extracts (0.5, 0-1.0 h). By being the most effective product, A. sinensis hexane extract gave significant protection comparable to that of its essential oil and the standard synthetic repellent, N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET: 6.25, 5.0-6.5 h). Qualitative gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated the presence of phthalides and phthalates, including 3-N-butylphthalide, butylidenephthalide, ligustilide, and di-iso-octyl phthalate, as the principal constituents in A. sinensis products. The success of A. sinensis products, particularly that of hexane extract, has proved their potential as bioactive candidates in the next step for developing and producing alternative natural repellents with commercial aspirations.",

            "content": "Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic agent used in the treatment of a variety of solid and haematopoietic tumours, but its use is limited by formation of metabolites that induce acute and chronic cardiac toxicities. Angelica sinensis has been widely used to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in China. In the present study, we used an in vivo mouse model to explore whether A. sinensis could protect against doxorubicin-induced chronic cardiotoxicity. Male ICR mice were treated with distilled water or water extraction of A. sinensis (15 g/kg, orally) daily for 4 weeks, followed by saline or doxorubicin (15 mg/kg, intravenously) treatments weekly. Cardiotoxicity was assessed by electrocardiograph, antioxidant activity in cardiac tissues, serum levels of creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and histopathological change in cardiac tissues. A cumulative dose of doxorubicin (60 mg/kg) caused animal death and myocardial injury characterized by increased QT interval and decreased heart rate in electrocardiograph, decrease of heart antioxidant activity, increase of serum AST, as well as myocardial lesions. Pre-treatment with A. sinensis significantly reduced mortality and improved heart performance of the doxorubicin-treated mice as evidenced from normalization of antioxidative activity and serum AST, preventing loss of myofibrils as well as improving arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities. Furthermore, the in vitro cytotoxic study showed that A. sinensis did not compromise the antitumour activity of doxorubicin. These results suggested that A. sinensis elicited a typical cardioprotective effect on doxorubicin-related oxidative stress, and could be a novel adjunct in the combination with doxorubicin chemotherapy.",

            "content": "Angelica sinensis, a perennial herb that produces ferulic acid and phthalides for the treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, prefers growing at an altitude of 1800-3000 m. Geographical models have predicted that high altitude, cool temperature and sunshade play determining roles in geo-authentic formation. Although the roles of altitude and light in yield and quality have been investigated, the role of temperature in regulating growth, metabolites biosynthesis and gene expression is still unclear. In this study, growth characteristics, metabolites contents and related genes expression were investigated by exposing A. sinensis to cooler (15 °C) and normal temperatures (22 °C). The results showed that plant biomass, the contents of ferulic acid and flavonoids and the expression levels of genes related to the biosynthesis of ferulic acid (PAL1, 4CLL4, 4CLL9, C3H, HCT, CCOAMT and CCR) and flavonoids (CHS and CHI) were enhanced at 15 °C compared to 22 °C. The contents of ligustilide and volatile oils exhibited slight increases, while polysaccharide contents decreased in response to cooler temperature. Based on gene expression levels, ferulic acid biosynthesis probably depends on the CCOAMT pathway and not the COMT pathway. It can be concluded that cool temperature enhances plant growth, ferulic acid and flavonoid accumulation but inhibits polysaccharide biosynthesis in A. sinensis. These findings authenticate that cool temperature plays a determining role in the formation of geo-authentic and also provide a strong foundation for regulating metabolites production of A. sinensis.",

At present, the majority of existing studies focus on the volatile oil and ferulic acid extracted from different parts of A. sinensis, but there is a dearth of scientific information on its water-soluble polysaccharides.,Aim of the study:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The structures of polysaccharides from plants, have been reported contributing to multiple pharmacological activities such as anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and liver protection. Therefore, the focus of this study was on its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro, which would be based on the various polysaccharides with distinct structures obtained from different parts of the A. sinensis root.,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Four parts of A. sinensis root were separated according to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia: head, body, tail and whole body. Crude polysaccharides were obtained by water extraction and ethanol precipitation method, and were further fractionated by DEAE Sepharose chromatographic column and gel filtration. The comparison of ASPs from different root parts were performed, including chemical compositions determined by colorimetric analysis, monosaccharide compositions measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), glycosidic linkage units determined by methylation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), organic functional groups determined by FT-IR, molecular weight (Mw) demarcated by gel permeation chromatography, and the viscosities and solubilities were measured according to method published in the previous report with minor modification. In vitro biological activities of APSs were compared on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory and oxidative stress models on IPEC-J2 cells.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Four purified polysaccharides, ASP-H-AP, ASP-B-AP, ASP-T-AP and ASP-Hb-AP from the root of A. sinensis, were obtained, and consisted of various contents of protein and the polyphenol. They were possibly pectic polysaccharides with a long homogalacturonan region as the main backbone and ramified with rhamnogalacturonan I region, but they were differed by subregions and the relative contents of glycosidic units. The Mw of four pectic polysaccharides were ranged from 67.9-267.7 kDa. The infrared spectrum also showed that the four polysaccharide fractions contained the characteristic peaks of polysaccharides. Their distinct primary structure could lead to a variety of biological activities. In vitro biological assays suggested that four polysaccharide fractions can protect IPEC-J2 cells against the LPS-induced inflammation by down-regulating inflammation factors and related genes on IPEC-J2 cells. These polysaccharides also could alleviate oxidative stress on IPEC-J2 cells by up-regulating the gene and protein expressions of antioxidant enzymes. It was concluded that ASP-H-AP possessed better anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects, while those of ASP-T-AP was relatively poor among the four polysaccharide fractions.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      All results indicated that the structure of pectic polysaccharides from different root parts of A. sinensis differed, which lead to their distinct anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. This may also be one of the factors why different parts of A. sinensis showed various pharmacological activities and applied independently in traditional use. In addition, it would be valuable for further studies on structure-activity relationship of polysaccharides obtained by different root parts of A. sinensis.",

In this study, we examined the effects and mechanisms of an arabinoglucan (AG) isolated from Angelica sinensis on DN, which was induced in rats by streptozotocin. The rats were intraperitoneally treated with AG for 8 weeks. Diabetic rats exhibited renal dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced creatinine clearance, increased blood urea nitrogen and proteinuria, along with marked enhanced mesangial expansion. All of these abnormalities were reversed by the AG. Overproliferation of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) was halted by AG treatment, and inflammation mediators were attenuated. Furthermore, the AG significantly inhibited the expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), both in diabetic kidneys and in high glucose-induced GMCs. Using an NF-κB inhibitor, RAGE siRNA and RAGE-overexpressing plasmid, we further demonstrated that the AG inhibited GMC viability mediated by RAGE/NF-κB signaling pathway. More importantly, we show that the AG can directly interact with RAGE and disrupt RAGE binding to advanced glycation end products using microscale thermophoresis. These findings suggest that this AG, acting as a RAGE antagonist, is a promising agent for the prevention and treatment of DN.",

This study aimed to investigate the active ingredients in A. sinensis with antioxidant properties and whether A. sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) protects H9c2 cells against oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Methods The ingredients of A. sinensis and their targets and related pathways were determined using web-based databases. Markers of oxidative stress, cell viability, apoptosis, and ER stress-related signalling pathways were measured in H9c2 cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ASP. Results The ingredient-pathway-disease network showed that A. sinensis exerted protective effects against oxidative injury through its various active ingredients on regulation of multiple pathways. Subsequent experiments showed that ASP pretreatment significantly decreased H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in H9c2 cells. ASP pretreatment inhibited H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species generation, lactic dehydrogenase release, and malondialdehyde production. ASP exerted beneficial effects by inducing activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and increasing ATF6 target protein levels, which in turn attenuated ER stress and increased antioxidant activity. Conclusions Our findings indicate that ASP, a major water-soluble component of A. sinensis, exerts protective effects against H2O2-induced injury in H9c2 cells by activating the ATF6 pathway, thus ameliorating ER and oxidative stress.",

Transcriptomics and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used for biological verification of some critical mutual metabolic pathways screened with metabonomics. The comprehensive analysis results showed that in a layer chicken liver injury model built with LPS and CS, 12 critical metabolic pathways were disturbed, involving 10 important differential metabolites. The hepatoprotective effect mechanism of CASP is related to the arachidonic acid metabolism and mTOR signaling pathways, involving nine important differential metabolites.

            "content": "Pulmonary fibrosis is a common delayed side effect of radiation therapy, and it has a poor prognosis. Tgfb1 is a potent chemoattractant for fibroblasts and stimulates the production of collagen, the protein that contains hydroxyproline. Since collagen is by far the most abundant protein in the lung, comprising 60-70% of the tissue mass, analysis of the hydroxyproline content in lung tissues provides a reliable quantitative index for pulmonary fibrosis. Thus hydroxyproline and Tgfb1 may be involved in the development of fibrosis. In this study, we investigated radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a mouse model. C57BL/6 mice were assigned into four groups: no treatment, treated with Angelica sinensis treated only, X-irradiated only (a single fraction of 12 Gy to the thorax), and Angelica sinensis treatment plus radiation. We assayed expression of hydroxyproline and the mRNA and protein of Tgfb1 in the four groups. We found that Angelica sinensis down-regulated the production of Tgfb1 and hydroxyproline in mice with radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis. This study has demonstrated for the first time that Angelica sinensis inhibits the progress of radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis, possibly by down-regulating the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine Tgfb1. These data suggest that Angelica sinensis may be useful in preventing and/or treating radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis in the clinic.",

            "content": "The study aims to investigate spatial distribution pattern and age structure of wild Angelica sinensis in Gansu province.Ten plots each with an area of 100 m2 were set and the spatial coordinates of all wild A. sinensis individuals were measured within each plot. Based on plant individual mapping data,we explored the spatial distribution pattern and its differences between different life history stages of wild A. sinensis in Gansu province by using nearest neighbor distance statistics. Correlation analysis were carried out to explore the relationship between spatial aggregation degree and topographic factors. We also distinguished individuals to three life history stages( i.e. seedlings,adults and boltings) and then test the differences among/between them using nonparametric test.(1)We found that the dominant spatial distribution pattern of wild A. sinensis population in Gansu was aggregated distribution. There was no significant correlation between spatial aggregation degree of wild A. sinensis and altitude,slope and aspect. There was no significant difference between the average distance from seedlings to their nearest bolting individuals; the average distance from adult individuals to their nearest seedlings was significantly larger than the average distance from adult individuals to their nearest adult individuals; and the average distance from bolting individuals to their nearest adult individuals was significantly smaller than the average distance from bolting individuals to their nearest bolting individuals.(2)The age structure was showed as a declining population,characterized by less seedlings and bolting individuals,while more adult individuals within population. The population characteristics of wild A. sinensis,characterized by aggregated distribution pattern and senescent type of age structure,are disadvantage to its population development. The factors,such as habitat specialization,human activities and intraspecific competition,which shapes the current population characteristics,may increase the threatened status of wild A. sinensis. We suggest to strengthen the protection of wild A. sinensis.",

            "content": "Most of the Pythium species are pathogenic to a wide range of economically important crops and, sometimes, can even cause diseases in animals and humans. An exception is that the soil-inhabiting P. oligandrum is an effective biocontrol agent against a diverse suite of pathogens and promotes plant growth. In this work, we sequenced the whole genome of P. oligandrum PO-1, isolated from rhizosphere soils of Chinese Angelica sinensis, using a combination of long-read single-molecule real-time sequencing technology (Pacific Biosciences [PacBio]) and Illumina sequencing. The 2.5-Gb and 5.2-Gb bases were generated respectively. The sequencing depths were 93× with PacBio and 145× with Illumina sequencing. With the PacBio sequencing results further corrected by Illumina sequencing, the genome was assembled into 71 scaffolds with a total size of 39.10 Mb (N50 = 1.45 Mb; L50 = 9)and the longest scaffold is 3.49 Mb. Genome annotation identifies 15,632 protein-coding genes and 0.47 Mb of transposable elements. Our genomic assembly and annotation have been greatly improved compared with the already released three genomes of P. oligandrum. This genomic data will provide valuable information to understand the mechanism underlying its biocontrol potentials and will also facilitate the dissection of genome evolution and environmental adaptation within the genus Pythium.

            "content": "Myelosuppression is the most common complication of chemotherapy. Decline of self-renewal capacity and stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) induced by chemotherapeutic agents may be the cause of long-term myelosuppression after chemotherapy. Whether the mechanism of SIPS of hematopoietic cells relates to chemotherapeutic injury occurred in hematopoietic microenvironment (HM) is still not well elucidated. This study explored the protective effect of Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP), an acetone extract polysaccharide found as the major effective ingredients of a traditional Chinese medicinal herb named Chinese Angelica (Dong Quai), on oxidative damage of homo sapiens bone marrow/stroma cell line (HS-5) caused by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and the effect of ASP relieving oxidative stress in HM on SIPS of hematopoietic cells. Tumor-suppressive doses of 5-FU inhibited the growth of HS-5 in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. 5-FU induced HS-5 apoptosis and also accumulated cellular hallmarks of senescence including cell cycle arrest and typical senescence-associated β-galactosidase positive staining. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was increased in 5-FU treated HS-5 cells and coinstantaneous with attenuated antioxidant capacity marked by superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Oxidative stress initiated DNA damage indicated by increased γH2AX and 8-OHdG. Oxidative damage of HS-5 cells resulted in declined hematopoietic stimulating factors including stem cell factor (SCF), stromal cell-derived factor (SDF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), however, elevated inflammatory chemokines such as RANTES. In addition, gap junction channel protein expression and mediated intercellular communications were attenuated after 5-FU treatment. Significantly, co-culture on 5-FU treated HS-5 feeder layer resulted in less quantity of human umbilical cord blood-derived hematopoietic cells and CD34⁺ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), and SIPS of hematopoietic cells. However, it is noteworthy that ASP ameliorated SIPS of hematopoietic cells by the mechanism of protecting bone marrow stromal cells from chemotherapeutic injury via mitigating oxidative damage of stromal cells and improving their hematopoietic function. This study provides a new strategy to alleviate the complication of conventional cancer therapy using chemotherapeutic agents.",

However, we lack evidence of the effect of AS on exercise performance and physical fatigue. We aimed to evaluate the potential beneficial effect of AS on ergogenic and anti-fatigue functions after physiological challenge. Male ICR strain mice were randomly assigned to four groups (n=10 per group) for treatment: (1) sedentary control and vehicle treatment (vehicle control); (2) exercise training with vehicle treatment (exercise control); (3) exercise training with AS treatment at 0.41 g/kg/day (Ex-AS1); and (4) 2.05 g/kg/day (Ex-AS5); both the vehicle and AS were orally administered for 6 weeks. Exercise performance and anti-fatigue function were evaluated by forelimb grip strength, exhaustive swimming time, and levels of serum lactate, ammonia, glucose, and creatine kinase (CK) after a 15-min swimming exercise. Trend analysis revealed that AS treatments significantly increased endurance swimming time and blood glucose level, and decreased serum lactate, ammonia and CK levels. Liver and muscle glycogen contents were higher for Ex-AS1 and Ex-AS5 groups than the exercise control. Therefore, AS supplementation improved exercise performance and had anti-fatigue properties in mice and may be an effective ergogenic aid in exercise training.",

            "content": "Angelica sinensis is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant that has been primarily used as a blood tonic. It largely relies on its bioactive metabolites, which include ferulic acid, volatile oils, polysaccharides and flavonoids. In order to improve the yield and quality of A. sinensis, the two cultivars Mingui 1 (M1), with a purple stem, and Mingui 2 (M2), with a green stem, have been selected in the field. Although a higher root yield and ferulic acid content in M1 than M2 has been observed, the differences of flavonoid biosynthesis and stem-color formation are still limited. In this study, the contents of flavonoids and anthocyanins were determined by spectrophotometer, the differences of flavonoids and transcripts in M1 and M2 were conducted by metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis, and the expression level of candidate genes was validated by qRT-PCR. The results showed that the contents of flavonoids and anthocyanins were 1.5- and 2.6-fold greater in M1 than M2, respectively. A total of 26 differentially accumulated flavonoids (DAFs) with 19 up-regulated (UR) and seven down-regulated (DR) were obtained from the 131 identified flavonoids (e.g., flavonols, flavonoid, isoflavones, and anthocyanins) in M1 vs. M2. A total 2210 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from the 34,528 full-length isoforms in M1 vs. M2, and 29 DEGs with 24 UR and 5 DR were identified to be involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, with 25 genes (e.g., CHS1, CHI3, F3H, DFR, ANS, CYPs and UGTs) mapped on the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and four genes (e.g., RL1, RL6, MYB90 and MYB114) belonging to transcription factors. The differential accumulation level of flavonoids is coherent with the expression level of candidate genes. Finally, the network of DAFs regulated by DEGs was proposed. These findings will provide references for flavonoid production and cultivars selection of A. sinensis.",

            "content": "The present work aimed to study the feasibility of Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) as an instinctive liver-targeting drug delivery carrier with applications in acute alcoholic liver damage (ALD). Amphipathic cholesteryl hemisuccinate-ASP (ASP-CHEMS) conjugate was synthesized by an esterification reaction and characterized by conventional methods. ASP-CHEMS self-assembled nanoparticles (ACNPs) and Curcumin-loaded ACNPs (Cur/ACNPs) were fabricated with a roughly spherical shape, and their sizes were ranged from 200 to 260 nm in aqueous solution. Compared with free Cur, Cur/ACNPs displayed enhanced solubility, good photostability, and a sustained release of Cur over 72 h. In the in vivo cellular uptake behavior study and in vivo bioimaging experiments, the ACNPs showed excellent liver-targeting capability because of the specific recognition by the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) overexpressed on the hepatocyte membrane. The tissue distribution of Cur/ACNPs in mice further demonstrated that ACNPs could distinctly enhance the distribution of Cur into the liver. Furthermore, Cur/ACNPs protected the liver from acute ALD by attenuating oxidative stress and were superior to the protective effects of free Cur and the Cur-loaded CHEMS modified-dextran derivative. According to the results, ACNPs may serve as a promising liver-targeting drug delivery carrier for liver disease prevention.",

            "content": "In order to form follicles and ovulate normally, there must be abundant blood vessels. Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (AS), as a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has the effects of tonifying the blood and activating the blood circulation. However, the effect of AS on angiogenesis in hen-follicles remains to be discovered. In this study, we identified vascular richness, granulosa layer thickness, expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31) and the content of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in granulosa layers to elucidate the effect of AS extract on angiogenesis in preovulatory follicles (F1-F3) of late-phase laying hens (75 wk). Based on network pharmacology, we predicted beta-sitosterol, ferulic acid, and caffeic acid as the main active components of AS, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) as hub targets of AS in angiogenesis. The intersection targets were enriched by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and the hub targets were verified by immunofluorescence and western blot. Molecular docking of active components with hub targets was performed and verified in vitro. The results showed that AS extract promoted angiogenesis in preovulatory follicles and increased granulosa cell layer thickness, CD31 expression and content of VEGFA. Experiments in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that AS extract promoted the expression of HIF1α and VEGFA, up-regulated the phosphorylation levels of VEGFR2. These results further demonstrated the reliability of molecular docking and network pharmacology findings. In summary, AS extract can promote angiogenesis in the preovulatory follicles in late-phase laying hens.",

Atherosclerosis is a common cardiovascular disease that requires urgent and careful attention. This study was conducted to predict and validate the potential molecular targets and pathways of Astragalus membranaceus and Angelica sinensis (A&A) in the treatment of atherosclerosis using network pharmacology. The active ingredients of A&A were obtained using the TCMSP database, while the target genes of atherosclerosis were acquired using 2 databases, namely GeneCards and DrugBank. The disease-target-component model map and the core network were obtained using Cytoscape 3.8.2 and MCODE plug-in, respectively. The core network was then imported into the STRING database to obtain the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network diagram. Moreover, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed using the HIPLOT online website. Finally, the small molecules related to key signaling pathways were molecularly docked and visualized. Under the screening conditions of oral bioavailability ≥ 30% and drug-likeness ≥ 0.18, 22 active ingredients were identified from A&A, and 174 relevant targets were obtained. Additionally, 54 active ingredients were found in the extracted core network. Interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway were selected as the main subjects through KEGG enrichment analysis. Core targets (RELA, IKBKB, CHUK, and MMP3) and active ingredients (kaempferol, quercetin, and isorhamnetin) were selected and validated using molecular docking.

Results of HPGPC and IC revealed that AASP was a neutral polysaccharide containing Ara, Gal and Glc in the mole ratio of 1.00 : 2.26 : 24.43, with the average molecular weight of 4.7 kDa. Periodate oxidation, Smith degradation, methylation, FT-IR, and NMR analyses further demonstrated that a preliminary structure of AASP was proposed as follows: (1→3)-linked arabinose, (1→6)-linked galactose, and (1→), (1→4), (1→6), (1→3,6)-linked glucose with α- and β-configuration. In Vivo antitumor assays, AASP exhibited prominent antitumor effects on H22 hepatoma cells with an inhibitory ratio of 48.57 % and effectively protected thymuses and spleens of tumor-bearing mice. Besides, AASP displayed a proliferation stimulating activity of immunocytes (splenocytes, peritoneal macrophages and natural killer cells), and an auxo-action for cytokines release (TNF-α, IL-2 and IFN-γ), leading to the apoptosis of H22 solid tumors cells via G0/G1 phase arrested. The above data demonstrated that AASP holds great application potential to be a safe and effective antitumor supplement in the future.",

Unprocessed AS and its four kinds of processed products (ASs) are used to treat blood deficiency syndrome in the country. The different blood-tonifying mechanisms of ASs remain unclear. In this work, a novel method integrating metabolomics and hematological and biochemical parameters was established to provide a complementary explanation of blood supplementation mechanism of ASs. Our results revealed that different ASs exhibited various blood supplementation effect, and that AS parched with alcohol demonstrated the best blood supplementation effect. Eight metabolites from liver tissue and 12 metabolites from spleen tissue were considered to be potential biomarkers. These biomarkers were involved in four metabolic pathways. Correlation analysis results showed that l-aspartic acid and l-alanine (spleen tissue), linoleic acid, and l-cystathionine (liver tissue) exhibited a high positive or negative correlation with the aforesaid biochemical indicators. The blood-supplementation effect mechanism of ASs were related to four metabolic pathways. l-Aspartic acid and l-alanine (spleen tissue), linoleic acid, and l-cystathionine (liver tissue) were the four key metabolites associated with the blood supplementation effect of ASs. This study gives a complementary explanation of the blood supplementation effect and mechanism of action of ASs.",

            "content": "The roots of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (Dang Gui; Apiaceae) have a long history in traditional Chinese medicine as a remedy for women's disorders and are often called \"lady's ginseng\". Currently, extracts of A. sinensis are commonly included in numerous dietary supplements used for women's health and as antiaging products. In the present study, we examined the potential chemopreventive activity of A. sinensis extracts by measuring the relative ability to induce the detoxification enzyme, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). The lipophilic partitions showed strong NQO1 induction with concentrations to double the enzyme activity (CD) of 5.5 +/- 0.7 (petroleum ether) and 3.9 +/- 0.5 microg/mL (chloroform). Fractionation led to the isolation of phenolic esters and alkylphthalides, especially Z-ligustilide, the main lipophilic compound, which showed strong NQO1 inducing properties (CD = 6.9 +/- 1.9 microM). Transcription of many detoxifying enzymes is regulated through the antioxidant response element (ARE) and its transcription factor Nrf2, which is repressed under basal conditions by Keap1. However, exposure to electrophilic inducers that alkylate Keap1 results in higher concentrations of free Nrf2 and ARE activation. The ARE reporter activity was therefore analyzed in HepG2-ARE-C8 cells after incubation with lipophilic extracts of A. sinensis or ligustilide for 24 h. Under these conditions, both the extract and the ligustilide increased ARE-luciferase reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation of ligustilide with GSH and subsequent LC-MS-MS analysis revealed that ligustilide as well as oxidized ligustilide species covalently modified GSH. In addition, using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and LC-MS-MS, it was demonstrated that the lipophilic extracts, ligustilide, and monooxygenated ligustilide alkylated important cysteine residues in human Keap1 protein, thus activating Nrf2 and transcription of ARE regulated genes. These observations suggest that A. sinensis dietary supplements standardized to ligustilide have potential as chemopreventive agents through induction of detoxification enzymes.",

            "content": "Root rot is a serious disease in plantations of Angelica sinensis, severely reducing yield and quality and threatening sustainable production. Fusarium isolates (n = 32) were obtained from field samples of root rot tissue, leaves, and infected soil. Isolates were identified by comparison of the sequences of their internal transcribed spacer region and translation elongation factor 1-α to sequences of known species in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. These Fusarium isolates include Fusarium tricinctum (43.75%), F. equiseti (31.25%), F. solani (9.37%), F. oxysporum (6.25%), F. acuminatum (6.25%), and F. incarnatum (3.12%). For pathogenicity testing under greenhouse conditions, seven isolates were selected based on a phylogenetic analysis, including four strains of F. tricinctum and one strain each of F. solani, F. oxysporum, and F. acuminatum. The seven isolates were all pathogenic but differed in their ability to infect: The four F. tricinctum strains were capable of causing root rot in A. sinensis at 100% incidence and were highly aggressive. Furthermore, the symptoms of root rot induced by those seven isolates were consistent with typical root rot cases in the field, but their disease severity varied. Observed histopathological preparations of F. tricinctum-infected seedlings and tissue slide results showed that this fungal species can penetrate epidermal cells and colonize the cortical cells where it induces necrosis and severe plasmolysis. Plate confrontation experiments showed that isolated rhizosphere bacteria inhibited the Fusarium pathogens that cause root rot in A. sinensis. Our results provide timely information about the use of biocontrol agents for suppression of root rot disease.",

Angelica sinensis is greatly demanded in the clinical practice of Chinese medicine due to its broad pharmacological activities of hematopoietic and anti-inflammatory properties. But, the percentage of early flowering in Angelica sinensis arrives to 20%~30%, which severely affects its quality and quantity. Here, transcriptome profiling and digital gene expression analysis were applied to study the mechanism of early flowering in Angelica sinensis. A total of 49,183,534 clean reads were obtained and assembled into 68,262 unigenes, and 49,477 unigenes (72.5%) could be annotated to a minimum of one database in the Nr, Nt, Swiss-Pro, GO, COG and KEGG. Taking the above transcriptome data as a reference, digital gene expression result showed that 5,094 genes expression level were significant changed during early flowering. These annotated genes offered much information promoting that the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites pathway, the hormone signal transduction pathway, and the transcription regulation system may be closely related to the early flowering phenomenon of Angelica sinensis. Further expression patterns of key genes contribute to early flowering were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR. The transcriptome result offered important gene expression information about early flowering in Angelica sinensis.",

In this study, two homogeneous polysaccharides (APS-4I and APS-4II) were isolated from Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels. APS-4I was a linear glucan with molecular weight of 16.1 kDa, which was composed of 88.4% α-1,6-Glcp, 4.1% α-1,2-Glcp, 3.9% α-1,3-Glcp, and 2.8% α-T-Glcp. APS-4II was a novel polysaccharide with molecular weight of 11.1 kDa, which consisted of 55.4% α-1,6-Glcp, 10.4% α-1,3,5-Araf, 8.7% α-T-Araf, 9.2% α-1,5-Araf, 4.0% α-1,3-Araf, 3.6% α-1,4-Galp, and 9.1% β-1,3-Galp.

Both APS-4I and APS-4II inhibited the tumor growth of B16-bearing mice, and the suppressive effect of APS-4II reached 64.7 ± 7.3%. Meanwhile, there were higher lymphocyte numbers and the levels of IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α in peripheral blood of APS-4II-treated mice than those in APS-4I-treated mice. Furthermore, APS-4II showed a higher inhibitory effect on the proliferation of B16 cells and stronger promoting effects on the proliferation of splenocytes, the phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages, and the cytotoxicity of NK cells.

            "content": "Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels root part is an integral component of traditional Chinese medicine, widely prescribed to improve blood circulation and blood stasis. However, early bolting of A. sinensis compromises the quality of the roots and hence is a major limitation for yield of medicinal materials. To date, little information about the molecular mechanisms underlying bolting is available for this important medicinal plant. To identify genes putatively involved in early bolting, we have conducted the transcriptome analysis of the shoot tips of the early-bolting plants and non-bolting (normal) plants of A. sinensis, respectively, using a combination of third-generation sequencing and next-generation sequencing. A total of 43,438 non-redundant transcripts were collected and 475 unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Gene annotation and functional analyses revealed that DEGs were highly involved in plant hormone signaling and biosynthesis pathways, three main flowering pathways, pollen formation, and very-long-chain fatty acids biosynthesis pathways. The levels of endogenous hormones were also changed significantly in the early bolting stage of A. sinensis. This study provided new insights into the transcriptomic control of early bolting in A. sinensis, which could be further applied to enhance the yield of medicinally important raw materials.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of AM&AS remain little understood. The purpose of this research was to explore the bioactive components and the mechanisms of AM&AS in treating SCI according to network pharmacology and the molecular docking approach.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      AM&AS active ingredients were first searched from Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) and Traditional Chinese Medicine Information Database (TCM-ID). Meanwhile, we collected relevant target genes of SCI through the GeneCards database, OMIM database, PharmGkb database, DurgBank database, and TDD database. By utilizing the STRING database, we constructed a network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). In addition, we used R and STRING to perform GO and KEGG function enrichment analyses. Subsequently, AutoDock Vina was employed for a molecular docking study on the most active ingredients and most targeted molecules to validate the results of the network pharmacology analysis mentioned above.,Result:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The overall number of AM&AS active compounds identified was 22, while the number of SCI-related targets identified was 159. Then, the 4 key active ingredients were MOL000098 quercetin, MOL000422 kaempferol, MOL000354 isorhamnetin, and MOL000392 formononetin. A total of fourteen core targets were TP53, ESR1, MAPK1, MTC, HIF1A, HSP90AA1, FOS, MAPK14, STAT1, AKT1, EGFR, RELA, CCND1, and RB1. The KEGG enrichment analysis results indicated that lipid and atherosclerosis, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, human cytomegalovirus infection, fluid shear stress, and atherosclerosis, etc., were enhanced with SCI development. Based on the analyses of docked molecules, four main active compounds had high affinity for the key targets.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Altogether, it identified the mechanisms by which AM&AS was used for SCI treatment, namely, active ingredients, targets and signaling pathways. Consequently, further research into AM&AS treating SCI can be conducted on this scientific basis.",

The separation was carried out using a Waters ACQUITY UHPLC BEH C18 column with gradient elution with 0.1% formic acid aqueous and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. Good linearity was attained with R2 of 0.9983-0.9998 in wide concentration ranges. The method had limit of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) in the range of 0.42-6.98 ng/mL and 1.39-23.28 ng/mL, respectively. Intra- and inter-day precisions varied with relative standard deviations (RSDs) from 0.33% to 0.88% and 0.37% to 1.04%, respectively. Moreover, the average recoveries were in a satisfactory range of 92.7%-102.1% with RSDs of less than 3.60%. Finally, the method was successfully applied to analyze 19 batches of A. sinensis samples grown in Min County, Gansu province, China, as well as that collected in other regions. The findings indicated that the established method is reliable and may thus be applied as a powerful tool for qualitative and quantitative analysis of components in A. sinensis, which has its implications in quality control of A. sinensis.",

However, there are hardly any robust markers indicating the processing procedure of wine-processed Angelica Sinensis, including the amount of rice wine and processing degree. A strategy integrating untargeted metabolomics and chemometric analysis for deducing robust markers was provided and applied to the discrimination of processing procedure. First, 86 compounds were tentatively identified in wine-processed Angelica Sinensis by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry. Second, 93 potential chemical markers were selected using multivariate analysis, among which nine robust chemical markers were selected by verification with commercial samples. Finally, the effects of processing temperature, time, and amount of rice wine on the three selected chemical markers were investigated through a rapid analytical method. It was demonstrated that both m/z 258.1097 and 238.1189 were positively correlated with the amount of rice wine and processing degree. In summary, this study introduced two candidate processing markers as robust markers for discriminating the processing procedures of wine-processed Angelica sinensis.

However, DG from different origins possess different quality, and difficult to identity. In this study, we used electronic nose technique to investigate DG from different producing areas for monitoring the correlation of origin and quality. The electronic nose was employed to establish classification model of DG originated from four main producing areas of Gansu, Yunnan, Sichuan and Hubei in China. Principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant function analysis (DFA) were performed to differentiate DG samples from four main producing areas. The content of phthalides of DG were determined to confirm the quality changes and investigate its correlation with the odor response values by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). The results of PCA and DFA analysis showed that the electronic nose could accurately distinguish DG from four main producing areas. The method of electronic nose for identification could be verified by GC-MS technology, and the main ingredient content was consistent with its odor of DG. In conclusion, electronic nose could effectively identify different origins of DG, and could be applied for rapid identification and quality control of genuine Angelica herbs.",

Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography( UPLC) was used to establish fingerprint for three processed products of A. sinensis,and determine the contents of 9 phenolic acids and phthalide compounds. The similarity was analyzed with Similarity Evaluation System for Chromatographic Fingerprint of Traditional Chinese Medicine,which showed that the chromatographic peaks of the same processed samples of A. sinensis were basically similar,with all similarities greater than 0. 950. The difference between different processed products and their control spectra was not obvious,with all similarities also higher than 0. 950.On the basis of using principal component analysis( PCA) and OPLS-DA to seek the difference components between groups,the improved distance coefficient method can be used to effectively distinguish the three processed products of A. sinensis by fingerprint similarity. At the same time,the determination method of nine phenolic acids and phthalide in A. sinensis was established by UPLC,and the comparison between different processed products was carried out. The results showed that the content of various components was changed as compared with the raw A. sinensis. The contents of coniferyl ferulate and ligustilide in the A. sinensis with alcohol were increased significantly,and the content of coniferyl ferulate was obviously increased in A. sinensis with soil.

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the protective effects of ASP on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC and to further explore the mechanisms. ASP could significantly ameliorate the symptoms of weight loss, disease activity index score, and colon shortening caused by DSS. ASP treatment also significantly suppressed the myeloperoxidase activity in colon tissues. Furthermore, after ASP administration, the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) induced by DSS was remarkably suppressed, and there was a definite improvement in the expressions of tight junction proteins, such as zona occludens 1, occludin, and claudin-1. In addition, the results of apoptosis experiments showed that the apoptotic events were noticeably reduced after ASP treatment. Taken together, these results suggested that ASP may be a potential natural agent against UC.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of APS on MDSC proliferation, differentiation and function through in vivo and in vitro experiments. In vitro, our results showed that APS promoted the proliferation, differentiation and immunosuppressive function of MDSC through STAT1 and STAT3 signaling pathways, and positively correlated with the expression level of Mannose receptor (MR, also known as CD206) and in a concentration-dependent manner on APS. In vivo, APS up-regulated T cells, γδT cells, CD8+T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes/macrophages, and granulocytes in the peripheral blood and spleen of mice to varying degrees and was accompanied by the same degree of increase in the proportion of MDSC. That reminds to the clinician that when applying APS as treatment they should pay attention to its possible side effects of increasing the quantity and function of MDSC, in order to increase its efficacy.",

            "content": "Radix Angelica Sinensis (RAS) has beneficial effects in patients suffering from cognitive impairment associated with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. It has previously been demonstrated that RAS prevents the neurotoxic effects of β-amyloid (Aβ) in vitro, protects from injuries due to oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis and ameliorates scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats. Here, we studied the effects of RAS on cognitive improvement and neurogenic enhancement and examined the possible underlying mechanisms in a rat model with permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, which serves as a model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-related neurodegenerative diseases. RAS enhances adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus following chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and improves the cognitive decline associated with hypoperfusion. Long-term ablation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis through cranial irradiation abolishes the protective effects of RAS on cognition. Furthermore, administration of RAS restores the decrease of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, the phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and the glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) staining intensity in rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. The present study supports the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis is required for RAS to facilitate recovery from the cognitive impairment induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, while neurogenic enhancement secondary to RAS treatment may be due to increased BDNF and phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element binding protein (p-CREB) levels and increased γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) expression. Based on the possible mechanisms suggested by the present study, this well-known traditional medicine may represent a candidate therapeutic agent for the treatment of dementia associated with vascular injury.",

Polysaccharides from Angelica sinensis (AP), a well-known Chinese herbal medicine, have been proved to have good immunomodulatory activity. In the present study, an enzyme-sensitive tumor-targeting nano drug delivery system (AP-PP-DOX (doxorubicin), PP stood for peptide) was constructed. In this system, Angelica polysaccharides act as not only carriers to targeted delivery of drugs to tumor tissue but also effectors to improve tumor microenvironment and enhance immune function, resulting in synergistic antitumor effect with chemotherapy drugs. The structure of this conjugate was confirmed by FI-IR and 1H-NMR. The particle size and zeta potential of the nanoparticles were 129.00 ± 3.32 nm and -28.45 ± 0.22 mV, respectively. Doxorubicin (DOX) and AP could be quickly released from the AP-PP-DOX under the presence of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). The released DOX showed good antitumor efficacy in vitro. The treatment of released AP moiety increased the expression of IL-2, while that of IL-10 was decreased, showing potential in restoring Th1/Th2 immune balance in tumor microenvironment. In a word, this drug delivery system, with specific tissue targeting and tumor microenvironment improvement, will open a new avenue for combination treatment of cancer.",

According to the characteristics of coumarin skeleton, suspension cultures of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels callus (A. sinensis callus) were employed because of the presence of diverse phenylpropanoids biosynthetic enzymes. As a result, 15 products were yielded from the suspension cultures, including a new coumarin: 8'-dehydroxymethyl cleomiscosin A (1), together with 14 known compounds. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis. Furthermore, the biotransformed pathways were discussed.

Iron depositions and iron concentrations in organs were determined by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and atomic absorption spectrophotometer.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      We found that ASP could inhibit tumor growth in mice xenografted with 4T1 and H22 cancer cells. In vivo experiments also showed that ASP could potently regulate hepcidin expression in liver and serum and decrease iron burden in liver, spleen and grafted tumors in mouse model. Treatment with ASP in hepatic cell lines reproduced comparable results in decreasing hepcidin as in mouse liver. Furthermore, we found that ASP markedly suppressed the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), JAK2, p-STAT3, and p-SMAD1/5/8 in liver, suggesting that JAK/STAT and BMP-SMAD pathways were involved in the regulation of hepcidin expression by ASP. We also found down-regulation of iron-related cytokines in ASP treated mice.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The present study provides new evidence that ASP decreases hepcidin expression, which can reduce iron burden and inhibit tumor proliferation. These findings might aid ASP developed as a potential candidate for cancer treatment in patients with iron overload.",

            "content": "The sustainable development of Angelica sinensis industry is seriously restricted by continuous cropping obstacles. In order to explore an efficient cultivation technique for A. sinensis, an experiment with five cropping patterns [A: Pisum sativum (Ps)-A. sinensis (As)-As, control); B: Ps-Triticum aestivum (Ta)-As; C: Ps-Mongolia astragalus (Ma)-As; D: Ps-Solanum tuberosum (St)-As); E: Ps-Fallow (F)-As)] were conducted in major A. sinensis producing areas located in Weiyuan County, Gansu Province. The physicochemical properties and relative abundance of bacterial genomic DNA in rhizosphere soil under different cropping patterns were measured during A. sinensis harvest period to investigate the effects of different cropping patterns on physicochemical properties, bacterial community diversity, and metabolic pathways. The results showed that: 1) the physicochemical properties in A. sinensis rhizosphere soil varied among different cropping patterns. Compared with the control, soil electrical conductivity under C pattern was significantly higher, and lower under B, D and E, CO2 respiration rate for B, C, D and E were significantly increased. 2) Soil bacteria of A. sinensis rhizosphere soil in the five cropping patterns belonged to 26 phyla and 368 genera. The dominant genera were Gemmatimonas from Gemmatimonadetes, Sphingomonas from Proteobacteria, and Subgroup_6 from Acidobacteria. Compared with the control, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria under B and C patterns was significantly higher, Acidobacteria in D pattern was significantly lower, while Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria in E pattern was significantly higher. 3) There were significantly negative relations between soil pH, electrical conductivity, contents of organic matter, available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium with the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in A. sinensis rhizosphere soil across the five cropping patterns. 4) There was significant difference in relative abundance for bacteria of six metabolic pathways under the five cropping patterns. In conclusion, C pattern had a regulating effect on physicochemical properties and bacterial communities in A.sinensis rhizosphere soil, which could be taken as a major practice to overcome the continuous cropping obstacles.",

This study aims to explore the effect of ATP on the growth and root quality of Angelica sinensis. To be specific, Mingui 1 was used, and through the pot(soil culture) experiment in the Dao-di producing area, the effects of conventional chemical fertilizer added with ATP on the morphology, photosynthesis, soil respiration, and content of ferulic acid and volatile oil in roots of Mingui 1 were detected. The underlying mechanism was discussed from the perspective of source-sink relationship. The results showed that ATP, via the fertilizer slow-release effect, could meet the needs of A. sinensis for nutrients at the root expansion stage, improve the net photosynthetic rate of leaves and aboveground biomass of plants, and promote the transfer and accumulation of nutrients from the aboveground part(source) to the underground root(sink) in advance during the dry matter accumulation period of roots, so as to improve the root weight per plant. ATP can increase the content of total ferulic acid(the sum of free ferulic acid and coniferyl ferulate), the main effective component of Angelicae Sinensis Radix, by promoting the synthesis of ferulic acid in the roots and the transformation to coniferyl ferulate. However, it had little effect on the content of volatile oil. ATP had certain influence on soil respiration, which needs to be further explored from root activity, rhizosphere microorganisms, and soil microorganisms. This study can lay a basis for soil remediation and improvement and ecological cultivation of A. sinensis.",

            "content": "Firstly, a linoleic and linolenic acid emulsion and fish feeds were incubated with graded levels of ethoxyquin (EQ) and petroleum ether extract, ethyl acetate extract (EAE), ethanol extract and aqueous extract of Angelica sinensis. The results showed that EQ and extracts of Angelica sinensis (EAs) inhibited lipid oxidation in material above. Of all of the examined EAs, EAE showed the strongest protective effects against the lipid oxidation. Moreover, EAE at high concentrations showed a stronger inhibitory effect on lipid oxidation than that of EQ. Next, 7 experimental diets that respectively supplemented 0.0, 0.2, 0.8 and 3.2 g kg-1 of EQ and EAE were fed to 280 juvenile red carp (Cyprinus carpio var. xingguonensis) with seven treatment groups for 30 days. The results indicated that dietary EAE improved growth performance in carp. Moreover, dietary EAE increased the activities of trypsin, lipase, alpha-amylase, alkaline phosphatase, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and decreased plasma ammonia content in carp. Meanwhile, dietary EAE reduced the levels of malondialdehyde and raised the activities of anti-superoxide anion, anti-hydroxyl radical, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase and the content of reduced glutathione in the hepatopancreas and intestine of carp. However, with the exception of GPT, dietary EQ got the opposite results to dietary EAE in carp. These results revealed that dietary EAE improved the digestive, absorptive and antioxidant capacities in fish. However, dietary EQ inhibited the digestive, absorptive and antioxidant capacities in fish. So, EAE could be used as a natural antioxidant for replacing EQ in fish feeds.",

With the aim of promoting products of plant origin as a viable alternative to conventional synthetic substances, this study was designed to transform AHE-based repellents for exploitable commercial production by enhancing their efficacy and assessing their physical and biological stability as well as repellency against mosquitoes under laboratory and field conditions.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The chemical profile of AHE was analyzed by qualitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. AHE was supplemented with vanillin, as a fixative, and then investigated for repellency and comparison to the standard synthetic repellent, DEET, under both laboratory and field conditions. Determination of physical and biological stability as a repellent was carried out after keeping AHE samples under varying temperatures and for different storage times.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      GC-MS analysis revealed that AHE contained at least 21 phytochemical compounds, constituting 95.74 % of the total content, with the major constituent of 3-N-butylphthalide (66.67 %). Ethanolic formulations of AHE and DEET showed improvement of repellency in a dose-dependent manner when vanillin was added in laboratory assessment. While 5-25 % AHE alone provided median complete-protection times of 2.0-6.5 h against Ae. aegypti, these times were increased to 4.0-8.5 h with a combination of AHE and 5 % vanillin (AHEv). Protection times against Ae. aegypti were extended from 2.25 to 7.25 h to 4.25-8.25 h when 5-25 % DEET was combined with 5 % vanillin (DEETv). In determining stability, all stored AHE samples exhibited similar characteristics such as liquid phases with aromatic odor comparable to those of fresh preparations. Furthermore, repellent activity of stored AHE samples lasted for at least six months, with varied efficacy (4.5-10.0 h) against Ae. aegypti. Field trials revealed strong repellency from both 25 % AHEv and 25 % DEETv, with complete protection (100 %) against a wide range of local mosquito populations. A total of 5,718 adult female mosquitoes, with the most predominant being Culex quinquefasciatus (41.47 %), Armigeres subalbatus (41.13 %), and Culex vishnui (10.53 %), was collected during field applications. No local skin reaction or other allergic responses was observed during both laboratory and field study periods.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Angelica sinensis proved to have not only impressive repellency against both laboratory Ae. aegypti and a wide range of natural mosquito populations, but also relative stability in physical and biological performance.",

Recently, positively charged nanoparticles-based adjuvant delivery systems have been extensively investigated as the novel vaccine adjuvant due to the protection antigens and drugs from degradation, promoting antigens and drugs uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs), and inducing strong humoral and cellular immune responses. In this study, the immunostimulant Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) was encapsulated into Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) PLGA nanoparticles, and the Polyethylenimine (PEI) was coated on the nanoparticles to develop a novel adjuvant (ASP-PLGA-PEI). To further investigate the adjuvant activities of ASP-PLGA-PEI nanoparticles for H9N2 vaccines in chickens and compare the adjuvant activities of nanoparticles adjuvant and conventional adjuvants (Alum and oil-based adjuvant), the H9N2 antigen was incubated with three different adjuvants and then immunized with chickens to evaluate the ability of inducing humoral and cellular immune responses. The results revealed that compared to Alum adjuvant, ASP-PLGA-PEI nanoparticles adjuvant stimulated higher antibody responses, promoted the activation of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, increased the expression of Th1 cytokines IFN-γ. Compared to oil-based adjuvant (ISA-206), ASP-PLGA-PEI nanoparticles adjuvant induced comparable antibody immune responses at later period after immunization, improved the activation of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. Therefore, compared to Alum and oil-based adjuvant, the ASP-PLGA-PEI nanoparticles serve as an efficient adjuvant for H9N2 vaccine and have the potential to induce vigorous humoral and cellular immune responses in chickens.",

In this paper, a simple, novel and efficient temperature-controlled hydrophobic ionic liquids-based ultrasound/heating-assisted extraction (TC-ILs-UHAE) procedure coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed and applied to the determination of ferulic acid (FA) in Chinese herbal medicine Angelica sinensis. During the extraction procedure, hydrophobic ionic liquids (ILs) were dispersed into water to form cloudy solution (fine droplets) with the aid of ultrasound and heating simultaneous. After extraction, phase separation was easily achieved by centrifuging at 0 °C. Among all ILs used, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide ([C4mim]NTf2) exhibited the highest extraction ability and the possible extraction mechanism was discussed. Additionally, the synergistic effect of heating and ultrasound on the extraction efficiency was investigated. Under the optimized conditions, a good linearity was observed with correlation coefficient (r) of 0.9995. The limit of detection of FA (LOD, S/N = 3) was 9.6 µg/L and the spiked recoveries of FA for real samples were in the range of 91.67 to 102.00% with relative standard deviation (RSD) lower than 3.87%. Compared with the traditional extraction methods, the proposed method gave the highest yield of FA and had the shortest extraction time. Therefore, this method is a potential simple, green and highly efficient technique and expected to be applied to the extraction of other bioactive ingredients in medicinal plants.",

We found that the production of ROS, NO, and MDA and the activity of iNOS, SOD and CAT were significantly increased in OA chondrocytes compared with human normal chondrocytes. When treated with H2O2, human chondrocytes exhibited acute oxidative stress injure, which was similar to OA chondrocytes. Pretreatment with ASP before H2O2 alleviated oxidative stress and protected human chondrocytes. The activity of PPARγ was decreased in OA chondrocytes and increased when treated with ASP. In conclusion, oxidative stress is an important pathogenesis of OA, and ASP inhibits H2O2-mediated injury in human chondrocytes.

Traditionally, ASR had to be pre-treated with yellow wine before the herbal preparation, which reduced the amount of volatile oil in water extract of ASR and DBT, and meanwhile the volatile oil-reduced DBT processed better bioactivities in cell cultures. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of volatile oil from ASR (Angelica oil) on the solubility of AR-derived ingredients and the biological properties of DBT.,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      To standardize Angelica oil, four marker chemicals in ASR were determined by GC-QQQ-MS/MS.

Here, transcriptomics profiles at four different growth stages (S1 to S4) were performed, gene expression was validated by qRT-PCR and the accumulation of endogenous hormones quantified by HPLC. A total of 60,282 unigenes were generated, with 2,282, 1,359 and 2,246 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) observed at S2 versus S1, S3 versus S2 and S4 versus S3, respectively; 558 genes that co-exist in at least three stages from S1 to S4 were obtained. Functional annotation classified 38 DEGs linked to flowering pathways: photoperiodism, hormone signalling, carbohydrate metabolism and floral development.

            "content": "Z-ligustilide (LIG), an essential oil extract from Radix Angelica sinensis, has broad pharmaceutical applications in treating cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Interaction of LIG with the major transport protein of human blood circulation, human serum albumin (HSA) has been investigated by steady-state, UV-vis and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic methods, as well as the effect of metal ions (e.g. Zn(2+), Cu(2+), Fe(3+), Co(2+), Ni(2+)) on the LIG-HSA system. Fluorescence results revealed that a moderate binding affinity (1.59 × 10(4) M(-1) at 298 K) between LIG and HSA with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Thermodynamic analysis of the binding data (ΔS = +12.96 J mol(-1) K(-1) and ΔH =- 20.11 kJ mol(-1)) suggested the involvement of hydrophobic and van der Waals forces, as well as hydrogen bonding in the complex formation. The specific binding distance r (3.75 nm) between donor (Trp-214) and acceptor (LIG) was obtained according to fluorescence resonance energy transfer. CD results showed that slight conformational changes occurred in the protein upon complexation with LIG.",

Group I was control group. Group II was treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI, 20 mg/kg/day) to induce anaemia. In group III, erythropoietin (EPO, 100 IU/kg/each) was administered in combination with ACEI. Group IV was treated with ASP (1 g/kg/day), extracted from A. sinensis root caps. In Group V, ASP (1 g/kg/day) was treated with ACEI. After 28 days, blood and tissue samples were collected for haematological and histopathological analysis, respectively.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The results showed that ACEI significantly reduced the haemoglobin (Hb, 10.0 g/dL), packed cell volume (PCV, 39.5%), red blood cells (RBCs, 6.2 million/mm3), mean corpuscular volume (MCV, 53.5 fL) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH, 16.2 pg/cell) values. In the group treated with ASP, the Hb (13.7 g/dL) and RBCs (7.8 million/mm3) increased significantly (p < 0.05). The combination of ASP and ACEI led to the significant (p < 0.05) reduction in Hb (10.7 g/dL), PCV (33.3%), RBCs (6.0 million/mm3), MCV (54.42 fL) and MCH (16.44 pg/cell) values.

The active ingredient profiles in P. ginseng single decoction and co-decoction of GA were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The experimental pharmacology method was used to explore the effect of GA co-decoction on the hematopoietic function of chemotherapy mice.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The active ingredient profiles of the co-decoction of GA significantly changed compared with those of the single decoction. Compared with GA1:0 (single decoction of Panax ginseng), the routine ginsenosides of all proportions of GA decreased significantly, but the proportion of rare ginsenosides increased significantly. The changes of contents of rare ginsenosides of GA were basically consistent with the trends of effects on the myelosuppression induced by CY. Compared with the model group, GA significantly increased the number of bone marrow nucleated cells, thymus index, peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets, and significantly reduced the spleen index. Moreover, GA could promote G1 phase bone marrow cells to enter the cell cycle, increase the proportion of S phase cells and G2/M phase cells, and increase the cell proliferation index.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      GA can ameliorate the hematopoietic function of mice after chemotherapy, and GA2:3, GA3:2 were the best, which may be due to the changes of the pharmacodynamic material basis of GA after compatibility.

Here we show that the protein hydrolyzate from Angelica sinensis was capable of increasing oxidative survival of the model animal Caenorhabditis elegans intoxicated by paraquat. The hydrolyzate was then fractionated by ultrafiltration, and the antioxidant fraction (<3 kDa) was purified by gel filtration to obtain the antioxidant A. sinensis peptides (AsiPeps), which were mostly composed of peptides with <20 amino acid residues. Further studies demonstrate that AsiPeps were able to reduce the endogenous ROS level, increase the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase, and decrease the content of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde in nematodes treated with paraquat or undergoing senescence. AsiPeps were also shown to reduce age pigments accumulation and extend lifespan but did not affect the food-intake behavior of the nematodes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that A. sinensis peptides (AsiPeps) are able to delay aging process in C. elegans through antioxidant activities independent of dietary restriction.",

            "content": "Background: To decipher the mechanisms of Angelica sinensis for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) using network pharmacology analysis. Methods: Databases were searched for the information on constituents, targets, and diseases. Cytoscape software was used to construct the constituent-target-disease network and screen the major targets, which were annotated with the DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) tool. The cardioprotective effects of Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP), a major component of A. sinensis, were validated both in H9c2 cells subjected to simulated ischemia by oxygen and glucose deprivation and in rats with AMI by ligation of the left anterior coronary artery. Results: We identified 228 major targets against AMI injury for A. sinensis, which regulated multiple pathways and hit multiple targets involved in several biological processes. ASP significantly decreased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cell death both in vitro and in vivo In ischemia injury rats, ASP treatment reduced infarct size and preserved heart function. ASP enhanced activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) activity, which improved ER-protein folding capacity. ASP activated the expression of p-AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α). Additionally, ASP attenuated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and maintained a balance in the oxidant/antioxidant levels after AMI. Conclusion:In silico analysis revealed the associations between A. sinensis and AMI through multiple targets and several key signaling pathways. Experimental data indicate that ASP protects the heart against ischemic injury by activating ATF6 to ameliorate the detrimental ER stress. ASP's effects could be mediated via the activation of AMPK-PGC1α pathway.",

The potential mechanisms underlying the activity of this compound were also considered. Specifically, serum and hepatic biochemical parameters were evaluated, and key proteins involved in the lipid/glucose metabolism were analyzed. Long-term feeding with a HFD induced severe fatty liver and hyperglycemia. Histological examination clearly showed that ASP reduced lipid accumulation in the liver and attenuated hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice. In addition, ASP markedly alleviated serum and liver lipid disorders and fatty liver via the upregulation of PPARγ expression and the activation of adiponectin-SIRT1-AMPK signaling. Furthermore, ASP also significantly relieved severe oxidative stress, demonstrating that ASP might attenuate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease via a \"two-hit\" mechanism. In addition, ASP reduced blood glucose levels and ameliorated insulin resistance via the regulation of related metabolic enzymes and by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway in HFD-fed mice. Our findings revealed that ASP might be used as an alternative dietary supplement or health care product to ameliorate metabolic syndrome in populations that consistently consume HFDs.",

            "content": "Nanoparticle vaccine delivery systems have been emerging strategies for inducing potent immune responses to prevent and treat infectious diseases and cancers. The properties of nanoparticle vaccine delivery systems, such as nanoparticle size, surface charge, and antigen release kinetics, have been extensively studied and proven to effectively influence the efficacy of vaccine responses. However, a few types of research have focused on the influence of administration routes of nanoparticle vaccines on immune responses. Herein, to investigate how the administration routes affect the immune responses of nanoparticles vaccines, we developed a nanoparticles system (NPs), in which the ovalbumin (OVA) and Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) were incorporated into poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles and the polyethylenimine (PEI) was coated on the surface of nanoparticles. The NPs vaccine was intramuscularly and subcutaneously injected (im and sc) into mice, and the immune responses induced by these two delivery routes were compared. The results showed that both im and sc administration of NPs vaccines elicited strong antigen-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibody responses, with no significant difference. In contrast, NP vaccines with sc administration significantly enhanced immune responses, such as enhancing the recruitment and activation of dendritic cells (DCs) in lymph nodes (LNs), promoting the antigen transport into draining lymph nodes, increasing the secretion of cytokines, improving the ratio of CD4+T cells to CD8+ T cells, activating cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, and inducing a strong cellular immune response. These results may provide a new insight onto the development of vaccine delivery systems.",

In this paper, a new method was established for the microanalysis of Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) in biosamples. Fluorescein-labelled ASP (FA) was rapidly eliminated from the bloodstream and distributed to the liver with high specificity following intravenous injection. The analysis of the hepatocellular localization demonstrated that FA was predominantly endocytosed by the parenchymal cells, an observation consistent with the results obtained from microscopy studies. Additionally, FA showed a high affinity for asialoglycoprotein receptor-rich cells, while minimal binding of FA to asialoglycoprotein receptor-poor cells was observed. Moreover, the absorption of FA was markedly inhibited by the co-administration of neogalactosylalbumin (NGA) both in vivo and in vitro. To allow for the visualization of the systemic circulation of ASP, 99mTc-DTPA-ASP was synthesized and in vivo imaging was performed with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). It also showed a high aggregation of 99mTc-DTPA-ASP in liver.

            "content": "Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is the second most prevalent anemia and frequently occurs in patients with acute or chronic immune activation. In the current study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) against ACD in rats and the potential mechanisms involved. The results showed that ASP inhibited inflammatory hepcidin in both HepG2 cells and ACD rats by blocking the IL-6/STAT3 and BMP/SMAD pathways. In ACD rats, the administration of ASP increased ferroportin expression, mobilized iron from the liver and spleen, increased serum iron levels, caused an elevation of serum EPO, and effectively relieved the anemia. Furthermore, ASP inhibited NF-κB p65 activation via the IκB kinases- (IKKs-) IκBα pathway, thereby reducing the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF-α, which is known to inhibit erythropoiesis. Our findings indicate that ASP is a potential treatment option for patients suffering from ACD.",

            "content": "Context Despite several pharmacological studies of volatile oils of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (Umbelliferae) (VOAS), its anti-inflammatory mechanism remains unknown. Objective The study investigates the effects of VOAS on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute inflammation rat model and analyzes its possible anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Materials and methods Fourty rats were randomly divided into the control, model, VOAS and dexamethasone (Dex) groups. The VOAS and Dex groups were given VOAS (0.176 mL/kg) and Dex (40 μg/kg), respectively. Rats in all groups except the control group were intraperitoneally injected with LPS (100 μg/kg), their exterior behaviour and liver pathological changes were observed, and the level of white blood cell (WBC), the number of neutrophils (NE)%, glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, histamine (HIS), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) were detected. Results Compared with the model group, VOAS and Dex significantly accelerated the recovery of the exterior behaviour, the liver pathological changes of rats, and increased the level of IL-10, but decreased the level of WBC, NE%, GOT, GPT, ALP, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, HIS, 5-HT, NO, PGE2, iNOS and COX-2 (p < 0.05). Conclusion VOAS exhibits anti-inflammatory and liver protection effects by inhibiting the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6), the inflammatory mediators (HIS, 5-HT, PGE2 and NO), the inflammation-related enzymes (iNOS and COX-2), as well as promoting the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10.",

            "content": "The demand for Angelicae Sinensis Radix, the dry root of Angelica sinensis, has been increasing year by year. However, the continuous cropping obstacles, frequent occurrence of pests and diseases, overuse of chemical pesticides, excessive pesticide residues and other problems in Angelicae Sinensis Radix production have attracted much attention. In this paper, we summarized the common diseases and pests attacking Angelica sinensis as well as the detection methods and characteristics of pesticide residues in Angelicae Sinensis Radix from 2002 to 2021. Additionally, we compared the limit standards of pesticide residues in Angelicae Sinensis Radix in and out of China and put forward suggestions for the high-quality and green development of Angelicae Sinensis Radix industry conside-ring the existing problems. The pesticide residues in Angelicae Sinensis Radix have been changing from organochlorines to organophosphorus pesticides. In recent years, some organophosphorus pesticides such as phorate, phoxim, isofenphos-methyl, phorate-sulfoxide, fenamiphos, isocarbophos, omethoate, and triazophos in Angelicae Sinensis Radix have seriously exceeded the standards. The detection methods of pesticide residues has evolved from chromatography to high performance chromatography-mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry(LC-MS), and some new detection techniques such as immunoassay have also been applied. Pesticide residues have become a primary factor that restricting the development of Angelicae Sinensis Radix industry. Therefore, moderate application of pesticides, establishment of ecological planting system, and strict limit standards of pesticide residues are necessary to solve the pesticide residue problem.",

            "content": "Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP), one of the major active ingredients isolated from the roots of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, possesses numerous bioactivities. The aim of the present study was to explore the mechanisms of ASP-mediated hypoglycemic effects in type 2 diabetic BALB/c mice induced by multiple low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) injections plus a long-term high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. The potential mechanism explicating the hepatoprotective effect was also considered. Specifically, serum and hepatic biochemical parameters were determined, as well as the key proteins involved in glucose metabolism and apoptosis. The multiple low-dose STZ injection plus HFD treatment induced significant hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and marked liver injury. Our results showed that ASP had beneficial effects in preventing hyperglycemia, stimulating insulin secretion, promoting hepatic glycogen synthesis, regulating adipokine release, reducing liver fat accumulation, and attenuating liver injury. Moreover, mechanistic studies illustrated that ASP could upregulate the expression of PPARγ and liver insulin signaling proteins, including IRS-2, PI3K, Akt, p-Akt and GLUT2, increase anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, decrease pro-apoptotic protein Bax expressions, and protect the mice against hepatic damage. These findings revealed the potential mechanisms of ASP-mediated therapeutic effects in diabetic mice. It suggested that ASP might be used in prescriptions or functional foods for the prevention or treatment of diabetes and liver diseases.",

            "content": "Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) play important roles in leukemia initiation, progression and relapse, and thus represent a critical target for therapeutic intervention. Hence, it is extremely urgent to explore new therapeutic strategies directly targeting LSCs for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) therapy. We show here that Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP), a major active component in Dong quai (Chinese Angelica sinensis), effectively inhibited human AML CD34+CD38? cell proliferation in vitro culture in a dose-dependent manner while sparing normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells at physiologically achievable concentrations. Furthermore, ASP exerted cytotoxic effects on AML K562 cells, especially LSC-enriched CD34+CD38? cells. Colony formation assays further showed that ASP significantly suppressed the formation of colonies derived from AML CD34+CD38? cells but not those from normal CD34+CD38? cells. Examination of the underlying mechanisms revealed that ASP induced CD34+CD38? cell senescence, which was strongly associated with a series of characteristic events, including up-regulation of p53, p16, p21, and Rb genes and changes of related cell cycle regulation proteins P16, P21, cyclin E and CDK4, telomere end attrition as well as repression of telomerase activity. On the basis of these findings, we propose that ASP represents a potentially important agent for leukemia stem cell-targeted therapy.",

Then, the BMSCs were divided into three groups as follows: normal control group (5.5 mmol·L⁻¹ glucose), high glucose group (25.5 mmol·L⁻¹ glucose), and ASP+high glucose group (25.5 mmol·L⁻¹ glucose +40 mg·L⁻¹ ASP). The proliferation activities of the BMSCs were detected by CCK8. Alizarin red staining, and alkaline phosphatase activity were used in the examination of osteogenic activity. Quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression levels of the osteogenic genes (Runx2, Osx, OCN, Col-Ⅰ) and the key factors of Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway (CyclinD1, β-catenin). In vivo, a type 2 diabetes rat model was established. The rats were divided into three groups, namely, the normal control group (normal rats), diabetes group (diabetic rats), diabetes+ASP group (diabetic rats, ASP feeding). Then, the tibia bone defect was established. The repair of bone defects in each group was observed through histological examination.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The proliferation of BMSCs was higher in the high glucose group and ASP+high glucose group than in the normal control group (P<0.05).

The present study is designed to investigate the protection of an ethanol extract of Angelica sinensis (Oliv) Diels (AE) against an ethyl acetate fraction of D. bulbifera (EF)-induced liver injury and its engaged mechanism. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that the amount of diosbulbin B in EF was 16.03% and ferulic acid in AE was 0.18%. EF (350 mg/kg) increased serum alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities and total bilirubin (TB) amount, while AE inhibited such an increase. Liver histological evaluation showed that AE prevented development of severe hepatic lesions induced by EF. Further results showed that EF decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and induced the cleaved activation of caspase-9 and -3, and all those effects were reversed by AE. AE also reversed EF-induced decreased expression of the inhibitor of kappa B (IκB), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Taken together, our results demonstrate that AE can prevent EF-induced hepatotoxicity via preventing apoptosis, meanwhile IκB, SOD, and GPx may be involved in such protection.",

Animals were randomly assigned to the following groups: control group; strenuous exercise group; and strenuous exercise and AS extract-treated group (300mgkg-1d-1). After 4 weeks, rats underwent exhaustive swimming and forelimb grip strength test. The blood biochemical markers and hepatic antioxidant activities were determined.

AS modulated the iron metabolism through decreasing serum hepcidin-25 concentrations by 33.0% (p<0.05) and increasing serum iron levels by 34.3% (p<0.01). The hepatic injury marker serum alanine aminotransferase concentrations were also reduced, followed by increased antioxidant enzyme catalase expression in the liver (p<0.05).

To investigate the geoherbalism and quality evaluation of AS, an ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF/MS) method was established to analyze and identify ferulic acid and phthalides in AS. The results showed that among samples collected in four regions, the relative contents of ferulic acid and phthalides were highest in samples collected in Gansu, and the samples from the four different regions were apparently classified into four groups. Meanwhile, the relative content in non-fumigated root was higher than after sulfur-fumigation and the sulfur-fumigated and non-fumigated samples were obviously divided into two groups by PCA. The paper establishes a systematic and objective evaluation system to provide a scientific basis for evaluating the quality of AS.",

            "content": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation occurs commonly and volatile oil from Angelica sinensis (VOAS) can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent. The molecular mechanisms that allow the anti-inflammatory factors to be expressed are still unknown. In this paper, we applied gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q/TOF-MS) based on a metabolomics platform coupled with a network approach to analyze urine samples in three groups of rats: one with LPS-induced inflammation (MI); one with intervention with VOAS; and normal controls (NC). Our study found definite metabolic footprints of inflammation and showed that all three groups of rats, MI, intervention with VOAS and NC have distinct metabolic profiles in urine. The concentrations of 48 metabolites differed significantly among the three groups. The metabolites in urine were screened by the GC-MS and LC-Q/TOF-MS methods. The significantly changed metabolites (p < 0.05, variable importance in projection > 1.5) between MI, NC and VOAS were included in the metabolic networks. Finally, hub metabolites were screened, including glycine, arachidonic acid, l-glutamate, pyruvate and succinate, which have high values of degree (k). the Results suggest that disorders of glycine, arachidonic acid, l-glutamate, pyruvate and succinate metabolism might play an important part in the predisposition and development of LPS-induced inflammation. By applying metabolomics with network methods, the mechanisms of diseases are clearly elucidated.",

            "content": "The present study explored the protective role of dietary the extract of Angelica sinensis (EAs) on high density, CuSO4, or trichlorfon-treated Crucian carp (Carassius auratus auratus). Firstly, the study showed that the optimum density for growth and growth inhibition was 0.49 and 0.98 fish L-1 water, respectively. Dietary EAs relieved the high density-induced growth inhibition in Crucian carp. The appropriate concentration of EAs for recovery of growth was estimated to be 4.30 g kg-1 diet in high-density fish. Moreover, high density decreased both digestive and absorptive enzyme activities and increased lipid oxidation in digestive organs, suggesting the ability of high density to induce oxidative damage. However, dietary EAs inhibited the oxidative damage through elevating ROS scavenging ability and enzymatic antioxidant activity in digestive organs. Secondly, our data demonstrated that the appropriate concentration of CuSO4 to induce the decrease in feed intake (FI) was 0.8 mg Cu L-1 water. Dietary EAs returned to FI of Crucian carp treated with CuSO4. The appropriate concentration of EAs for recovery of FI was estimated to be 4.25 g kg-1 diet. Moreover, dietary EAs suppressed the CuSO4-induced decrease in digestion and absorption capacity and increase in protein metabolism in digestive organs of Crucian carp. Finally, the present results suggested that dietary EAs inhibited the trichlorfon-induced rollover (loss of equilibrium) in Crucian carp. The appropriate concentration of EAs for inhibition of rollover was estimated to be 4.18 g kg-1 diet. Moreover, trichlorfon stimulated not only the decrease in energy metabolism but also lipid and protein oxidation, suggesting that trichlorfon caused loss of function and oxidative damage in muscles of fish. However, dietary EAs improved muscular function and inhibited oxidative damage via quenching ROS and elevating non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant activity in muscles of trichlorfon-induced fish. So, EAs could be used as an inhibitor of high density, CuSO4, and trichlorfon stress in fish.",

            "content": "Ethnopharmacological relevance:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Herb compatibility is one of the most important characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Rather than being used singly, Chinese herbs are often used in formulae to obtain synergistic effects or to diminish possible adverse reactions. Herb pair, the most fundamental and simplest form of multi-herb formulae, is a centralized representative of herb compatibility. Danggui (Angelicae Sinensis Radix), a widely used Chinese medicine, is usually combined with another herb to treat women's diseases in the clinic. A series of herb pairs containing Danggui have gradually become a focus of modern research, and they exhibit encouraging prospects for development.,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      A systematic search for studies related to herb pairs containing Danggui was performed via a library search (books, theses, reports, newspapers, magazines, and conference proceedings) and an electronic search (Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar). These sources were scrutinized for information on Danggui herb pairs.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Based on a previous statistical analysis, a database containing 16,529 formulae of Danggui from the \"Dictionary of Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulae\" was reviewed. The results showed a high frequency of compatibility between Danggui and other 22 herbs. The most common ratio among these chosen herb pairs was 1:1, and a majority of the pairs were applied for the treatment of diseases in internal medicine. The present paper reviews ethnopharmacology and advances in variations of the bio-active components and compatibility effects of the herb pairs containing Danggui, especially Danggui-Huangqi, Danggui-Chuanxiong, and Danggui-Shaoyao, which are used at high frequency. It was also observed that there were fewer studies of Danggui-Fuzi, Danggui-Huanglian, Danggui-Gancao, Danggui-Fangfeng and Danggui-Ganjiang, although they have been recorded in classical books as commonly used herb pairs. Moreover, some herb pairs such as Danggui-Niuxi and Danggui-Chaihu have been used at high frequency according to the statistical analysis, however, they were not recognized as herb pairs in many relevant books.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Recently, several TCM researchers have become interested in investigating the bio-active constituents and compatibility effects of herb pairs. Thus, some methods for in-depth study of herb pairs are essential to be established. The in vitro or in vivo bio-active constituents of herb pairs may differ from those of the single herbs. Additionally, comparative methods should be applied to study not only the bio-active constituents but also the effects of herb pairs. Study of component compatibility may be considered when the bio-active constituents and effects of an herb pair have been definitively demonstrated. Overall, the goal of our basic study of herb pairs should be their clinical application and the development of new drugs.",

The bone (femur) mineral density (BMD) of rats treated with the extract (300 mg/kg) was significantly higher than that of the OVX-control, reaching BMD of the estradiol group. Markers of bone turnover in osteoporosis, serum alkaline phosphatase, collagen type I C-telopeptide and osteocalcin, were significantly decreased in the extract group. The body and uterus weight and serum estradiol concentration were not affected, and no treatment-related toxicity was observed during extract administration in rats.

Meanwhile, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the data obtained from flow-injection mass spectrometric (FIMS) fingerprints, which can analyze each sample in 2 min, compared with 30 min required for the chromatographic fingerprint. Both methods show significant chemical differences between samples that may be due to differences in growing locations, growing conditions, harvesting times, and/or botanical processing.

            "content": "Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels is an important Chinese medicinal plant. A. sinensis seedlings are grown on an undisturbed alpine meadow soil to ensure the high-quality seedlings, but these soils are disappearing year after year. Thus, selecting a suitable bed soil for A. sinensis seedlings could ensure their long-term sustainability. Using HiSeq sequencing of 16S and 18S marker genes, we investigated the rhizosphere bacterial and fungal microbiotas of the seedlings grown in wheat, astragalus, potato, and angelica-cultivated soils at a geo-authentic habitat. Co-occurrence network analysis, canonical correspondence analysis, Mantel test, and Envfit test were used to examine the relationship between the microbiotas and the surrounding factors. Astragalus-cultivated soils exhibited the following properties: the highest plant weight, the highest neighborhood connectivity in the bacterial network, the highest ratio of positive/negative relationship in both bacterial and fungal networks, the highest relative abundance of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and the ectomycorrhizal fungi, the lowest relative abundance of Rhizoctonia solani, the suitable soil pH, and the close relationship between the rhizosphere microbiotas and the ecological factors. Moreover, each growth stage has its own major drivers in all crop-cultivated soils. Climate temperature and soil pH at 56 days after planting, precipitation at 98 days, and plant weight as well as microbial biomass C and N at 129 days were the major drivers of the bacterial and fungal microbiotas. Overall, the astragalus-cultivated soil was a suitable bed soil for nurturing A. sinensis seedlings to replace the undisturbed alpine meadow soils.",

            "content": "Angiogenesis plays an important role in a wide range of physiological processes such as wound healing and fetal development. Many diseases are associated with imbalances in regulation of angiogenesis, in which it is either excessive or there is insufficient blood vessel formation. Angelica sinensis (AS), commonly used in the prescriptions of Chinese medicine, is a potential candidate for curing such diseases. However, biological effects of AS on angiogenesis and underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully elucidated. This investigation describes the angiogenic effects of AS extract on human endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro and zebrafish in vivo. The extract was demonstrated, by XTT assay and microscopic cell counting, to stimulate the proliferation of HUVEC; in addition, flow cytometry analysis indicated that the extract increased the percentage of HUVEC in the S phase. The wound healing migration assay illustrated that a dramatic increase in migration could be measured in AS extract-treated HUVEC. Meanwhile, the number of invaded cells and the mean tube length were significantly increased in AS extract treatment groups. The extract was also demonstrated to promote changes in subintestinal vessels (SIVs) in zebrafish, one feature of angiogenesis. In addition, AS extract was found by real-time PCR to enhance vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression. In a bead-based immunoassay, higher levels of p38 and JNK 1/2 expression were also observed in effusions compared with control cells. All results suggest that Angelica sinensis extract can promote angiogenesis, and that the angiogenic effects involve p38 and JNK 1/2 phosphorylation.",

The production optimization, purification and characterization of the purified EPS from A. tenuissima F1 and the in-vitro antioxidant potentials was investigated. Results showed the optimal medium composition were 8% mannose, 2% yeast extract, 0.04% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.005% Vc, and the optimal cultivation conditions were set at initial pH 7.0, culture temperature 30 °C, inoculum size of 3%, 180 r/min for 5 d. The EPS purified by ion exchange column chromatography and gel chromatography was a non-reducing sugar and glycoprotein with pyranoid ring by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis, displayed a porous network structure by scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation and exhibited a high thermal stability with the degradation temperature of 303.9 °C by thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DSC). Molecular weight of the purified EPS was 3.246 × 104 g/mol, and EPS was composed of d-galacturonic acid, rhamnose, d-mannose, glucose, and d-galactose in ratio of 0.45:3.02:3.25:1.0:0.95.

In order to identify endophytes with high cellulase activity, we screened endophytes taken from different parts of Angelica sinensis using the Congo red staining method. We identified three strains with higher cellulase activity. Of the 3 strains identified, No.Lut1201 increased the yield of extracted Z-ligustilide 2 fold compared to commercially available cellulase (Ningxia Sunson) using a cellulase-assisted extraction method and traditional extraction methods. Scanning electron microscopy clearly demonstrated that the cellulase extracted from endophytes enhance cell wall polysaccharide degradation as well as Z-ligustilide extraction from Radix Angelica sinensis (RAS).

As a step further to identify and characterize the active chemical components of DBT, we tested the hematopoietic and particularly, thrombopoietic effects of polysaccharide-enriched fractions from the root of Radix Angelicae Sinensis (APS) in this study.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      A myelosuppression mouse model was treated with APS (10 mg/kg/day). Peripheral blood cells from APS, thrombopoietin and vehicle-treated samples were then counted at different time-points. Using the colony-forming unit (CFU) assays, we determined the effects of APS on the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and megakaryocytic lineages. Using a megakaryocytic cell line M-07e as model, we analyzed the cellular apoptosis progression with and without APS treatment by Annexin V, Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Caspase 3 assays. Last, the anti-apoptotic effect of APS on cells treated with Ly294002, a Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinse inhibitor (PI3K) was also tested.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      In animal models, APS significantly enhanced not only the recovery of platelets, other blood cells and their progenitor cells, but also the formation of Colony Forming Unit (CFU). In M-07e cells, we observed the anti-apoptotic effect of APS. Treatment by Ly294002 alone increased the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. However, addition of APS to Ly294002-treated cells significantly reduced the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      APS promotes hematopoiesis and thrombopoiesis in the mouse model. This effect likely resulted from the anti-apoptosis activity of APS and is likely to involve the PI3K/AKT pathway.",

            "content": "Numerous reports assigning (Z)-ligustilide (1) the role of a major bioactive principle in Apiaceae botanicals are called into question by the recurrent demonstrations of 1 being an unstable, rapidly degrading compound, ultimately leading to dynamic residual complexity. While Angelica sinensis is recognized for its therapeutic value in (peri-)menopausal symptom management, its purported active principle, 1, represents a typical example of the instability-bioactivity chasm of botanicals. To help bridge the gap, this study used both the essential oil and purified 1 obtained from A. sinensis to investigate the factors that influence the chemical transformation of 1, the products formed, and the rationale for monitoring 1 in natural product preparations. Countercurrent separation was used to purify 1 from a supercritical fluid extract of A. sinensis, achieving 93.4% purity in a single step. Subsequent purification by preparative HPLC afforded 1 with a 98.0% purity. Providing a mass balance setting, we monitored chemical changes occurring to highly purified 1 under various conditions and at different time points, in sealed NMR tubes by quantitative 1H NMR (qHNMR). The nondestructive nature of NMR enabled a comprehensive assessment of degradation products. Moreover, in being a mole-based determination, the total intensity (integral) of all NMR signals intrinsically represents the theoretical mass balance within the sample solution. The results demonstrated that 1 is most stable while within the original plant material. Exposure to light had a profound impact on the chemical transformation of 1, leading to the formation of ligustilide dimers and trimers, as verified by both NMR and LC-HRMS studies. Moreover, the results shown for 1, augmented by other recent outcomes, have serious implications for the meaningful biological evaluation of NPs that exhibit instability/reactivity, while having a plethora of \"promising\" bioactivities reported in the literature and being frequently associated with unsubstantiated health claims.",

N-butylidenephthalide (BP), a bioactive compound in danggui, is a potential antitumor agent for various cancer types. However, its clinical effect and mechanism in the treatment of gastric cancer remain undetermined.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The in vivo protective effect of danggui in patients with gastric cancer were validated using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). The genes induced by BP-treatment were analyzed by whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and validated by real-time PCR, western blot and siRNA transfection. The effect of BP on AGS cell migration and invasion was evaluated in transwell assays. The antitumor effects of BP were evaluated in vivo in an AGS xenograft animal model.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Danggui users were found to have an increased survival rate when compared with danggui nonusers (log-rank test p = 0.002) . The use of danggui highly associated with decreased mortality (the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of danggui user was 0.72 [95 % CI, 0.57-0.92] (p = 0.009). The in vitro results showed that BP inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation, and triggered cellular apoptosis depending on the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Using RNA-seq analysis we found that REDD1 was the highest transcript induced by BP in gastric cancer cells. BP induce an increase of REDD1 expression that inhibits mTOR signaling, thus inhibiting gastric cancer growth. We used RNA interference to demonstrate that the knock-down of REDD1 attenuated the BP-induced mTORC1 activation and growth inhibition. BP suppressed the growth of AGS xenografts tumor in vivo.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Danggui can prolong the survival rate of gastric cancer patients in Taiwan. BP caused gastric cancer cell death through the activation of mitochondria-intrinsic pathway and induced the REDD1 expression leading to mTOR signal pathway inhibition in gastric cancer cells. BP inhibited the in vivo growth of AGS xenograft tumors. These results may provide the basis for a new therapeutic approach toward the treatment of gastric cancer progression.",

Abeta is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease; it decreased viability of Neuro 2A cells in a concentration-dependent manner with IC(50) of 14.9 microM. AS extract resulted in dose-dependent anti-Abeta toxicity according to MTT assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) analysis revealed a significant production of hydrogen peroxide, decreased glutathione (GSH) levels and increased lipid peroxidation (TBARS value) in the Abeta-treated Neuro 2A cells. The Abeta-treated cells also showed a significant decline in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) and increase in the mitochondrial volume, and portions of the cytoplasm were sequestered by a membrane-bound vacuole. The malfunctions of Neuro 2A cells caused by Abeta were attenuated using AS extract. The AS extract protected cell viability against Abeta-induced oxidative damage (ROS, TBARS, and GSH contents) and rescued the DeltaPsim levels in a dose-dependent manner: the dosages of 25, 50, 100, and 200 microg/ml recovered 77%, 87%, 102%, and 105% of DeltaPsim, respectively. AS extract also recovered the enlarged mitochondria mass with dosages from 25 to 200 microg/ml. The results of this study demonstrated that AS extract possessed the activity to prevent the neurotoxicity induced by Abeta-associated oxidative stress, implying that AS has a potential role in the prevention of Alzheimer's diseases.",

            "content": "A novel fluorescent sensor was developed in this study based on glutathione-functionalized graphene quantum dots (GQDs@GSH) to detect organophosphorus pesticide residues in Radix Angelica Sinensis. GQDs@GSH was synthesized by a one-step pyrolysis method with a fluorescence quantum yield as high as 33.9% and its structure was characterized by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. GQDs@GSH exhibited excellent fluorescence property showing strong blue fluorescence under UV irradiation. The fluorescence of GQDs@GSH could be quenched by Fe3+ by electron transfer and the quenched fluorescence could be recovered due to the strong chelating and reducing ability of phytic acid (PA). Under the catalyzation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline oxidase (ChOx), acetylcholine (ACh) could be decomposed to H2O2, which could further oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+ thus quenching the fluorescence of GQDs@GSH once again. Coumaphos, a kind of organophosphorus pesticide, could inhibit AChE activity, thus making the quenched fluorescence turn on again. Several parameters influencing the fluorescence response such as Fe3+, PA, ACh and coumaphos concentration, pH value and reaction time were optimized. Based on such a fluorescence \"off-on-off-on\" ngkmechanism, GQDs@GSH was successfully applied to the detection of coumaphos in Radix Angelica Sinensis. A good linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and coumaphos concentration was obtained in the range of 0.1-10.0 μmol·L-1. By a standard addition method, the recoveries were measured to be 101.44-117.90% with RSDs lower than 1.98%. The biosensor system is simple, sensitive and accurate. It has a good application prospect in the detection of organophosphorus pesticide residues in traditional Chinese medicine and agricultural products, and also expanded the application scope for glutathione as a highly selective biological molecule.",

Meanwhile, plasma and urine metabolites were detected and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis method. The results of hemorheology, coagulation function parameters and metabolomics all showed that the BSS model was successfully established, DGPPs intervention could significantly relieve rats BSS and the therapeutic effect of JDG was best. Moreover, 23 differential metabolites (14 in plasma and nine in urine) were identified that were closely related to the BSS, involving seven potential target metabolic pathways. DGPP intervention showed different degrees of reverse effect on these metabolites. JDG was the most effective owing to extensive regulation effect on differential metabolites. This study provides a reference for understanding the pathological mechanism of BSS and the mechanism of DGPPs, which lays a theoretical foundation for the rational use of DGPPs in clinical practice.",

Then, the capacity of oral absorption of cASP was evaluated. The results demonstrated that cASP had low toxicity and no disruption on the integrity of cell membrane. The endocytosis of cASP into the epithelial cells was time- and energy-dependent, which was mediated by macropinocytosis pathway and clathrin- and caveolae (or lipid raft)-related routes. Otherwise, the actin filaments played a relatively weak role at the same time. The transport study illustrated that cASP could penetrate through the epithelial monolayer and mainly mediated by the same routes as that in the endocytosis experiment. Moreover, both in vitro Ussing chamber and in vivo ligated intestinal loops models indicated that cASP could be diffused through the mucus barriers and be absorbed in the whole small intestine. Finally, near-infrared fluorescence imaging presented that cASP could be absorbed and circulated into the blood, then distributed into various organs after oral administration. In conclusion, ASP could be absorbed after oral administration through endocytosis process mainly mediated by macropinocytosis pathway and clathrin- and caveolae (or lipid raft)-related routes, then be absorbed and circulated into blood. This study presents a comprehensive understanding of oral delivery of cASP, which will provide theoretical basis for the clinical application of ASP.",

According to morphology and molecular biology properties, this virus, which has a flexuous rod-shaped particle about 750 nm in length and 12 nm in width, was assigned to the genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae. Its coat protein (CP) shows high similarity with six other potyviruses by analysis of peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF). The 919 bp nucleotides of 3' terminal covering partial CP gene and 3'-untranslated region was amplified by RT-PCR using degenerate primers which were designed according to the result of PMF. In sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis, the new isolate was found to be closely related to Japanese hornwort mosaic virus (JHMV), Konjak mosaic virus (KoMV), and Zantedeschia mosaic virus (ZaMV). The most closely related virus is JHMV03 (AB251346), with 96.59% aa and 87.60% nt identity to the isolate. All results suggest the presence of a new member of potyvirus, tentatively named Dang Gui strain of Japanese hornwort mosaic virus (JHMV-DG*). In our research the antiserum against the CP of JHMV-DG had also been prepared. To our knowledge, it is the first time that a potyvirus has been isolated and identified in Angelica sinensis.",

The effect of BP in bladder cancer treatment is still unclear and worth for further investigate.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Changes of patients with bladder cancer after Angelica Sinensis exposure were evaluated by analysis of Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) database. The anti-proliferative effect of BP on human bladder cancer cells was investigated and their cell cycle profiles after BP treatment were determined by flow cytometry. BP-induced apoptosis was demonstrated by Annexin V-FITC staining and TUNEL assay, while the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins were determined by western blot. The migration inhibitory effect of BP on human bladder cancer cells were shown by trans-well and wound healing assays. Tumor model in NOD-SCID mice were induced by injection of BFTC human bladder cancer cells.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The correlation of taking Angelica sinensis and the incidence of bladder cancer in NHIRD imply that this herbal product is worth for further investigation. BP caused bladder cancer cell death in a time- and dose- dependent manner and induced apoptosis via the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. BP also suppressed the migration of bladder cancer cells as revealed by the trans-well and wound healing assays. Up-regulation of E-cadherin and down-regulation of N-cadherin were evidenced by real-time RT-PCR analysis after BP treatment in vitro. Besides, in combination with BP, the sensitivity of these bladder cancer cells to cisplatin increased significantly. BP also suppressed BFTC xenograft tumor growth, and caused 44.2% reduction of tumor volume after treatment for 26 days.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      BP caused bladder cancer cell death through activation of mitochondria-intrinsic pathway. BP also suppressed the migration and invasion of these cells, probably by modulating EMT-related genes. Furthermore, combination therapy of BP with a lower dose of cisplatin significantly inhibited the growth of these bladder cancer cell lines. The incidence of bladder cancer decreased in patients who were exposed to Angelica sinensis, suggesting that BP could serve as a potential adjuvant in bladder cancer therapy regimen.",

Furthermore, both the percentage of CD4(+) cells and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio in peripheral blood cells were significantly enhanced by APS-1 at 3-30 mg/kg. In addition, the reduced thymus/body weight index by murine leukemia virus infection was increased by ASP-1 in a dose dependent manner.

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was applied to detect metabolites in the urine samples in different collection periods. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to investigate the differences in metabolic profiles among control group (CG), blood deficiency model group (MG), AS groups, and Colla Corii Asini group (CCAG). The potential biomarkers were identified based on the variable importance in the projection (VIP), T-test, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and mass spectra library. The metabolites were analyzed using metabolomics pathway analysis (MetPA) to build the metabolic pathways. Our results indicated that, on the seventh day, the levels of glucose, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, alanine, acetoacetic acid, and citric acid changed significantly in blood deficiency mice. However, these metabolic deviations came to closer to normal levels after AS intervention. The reversing blood-deficiency mechanism of AS might involve regulating synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, Pyruvate metabolism, TCA cycle, and Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis. In conclusion, metabonomics is a robust and promising means for the identification of biomarkers and elucidation of the mechanisms of a disease, thereby highlighting its importance in drug discovery.",

The eight mycotoxins were extracted and cleaned up by using QuEChERS-based procedure, and then were quantified under the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) together with positive and negative ionization modes. Focusing on the optimization of extraction and clean-up conditions, as well as UFLC separation and MS/MS parameters of targeted analytes, the developed method expressed good linearity for the eight mycotoxins within their respective linear ranges with correlation coefficients all higher than 0.9974. The limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) ranged from 0.005 to 0.125 μg/kg and from 0.0625 to 0.25 μg/kg, respectively. Recoveries for spiked A. sinensis sample at three different levels were all above 78.9% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 6.36% for all analytes. Analysis of real samples demonstrated that two visibly moldy A. sinensis samples were detected with AFB1 of 2.07 and 2.92 μg/kg, and AFG1 of 2.84 and 1.53 μg/kg. The proposed quantitative method with significant advantages including simple pretreatment, rapid determination and high sensitivity would be the preferred candidate for the determination and quantification of multi-class mycotoxin contaminants in complex matrixes, which well fulfilled the maximum residue limits (MRLs) from various countries.",

The planting patterns were conducted as hole seeding under ridging with plastic-film mulching (LS), trenching and slant planting under film-side cultivation (MC) and trenching and slant planting in open field (LD). Our results showed that, 1) compared with LD, soil organic matter content in top layer under the treatments of LS and MC was increased by 4.4% and 14.3%, respectively, with that under MC being statistically significant. Soil bulk density was significantly decreased by 11.6% and 8.5%, while pH was significantly decreased by 4.6% and 1.7%. The activities of soil sucrase, phosphatase and urease were significantly increased by the two mulching methods, but that of catalase was inhibited to a certain extent. 2) Mulching film improved the speed of returning green after transplanting, the early bolting rate, and the individual medicinal quality of A. sinensis. MC showed the fastest, the most uniform, and the highest greening rate. LS bolting rate was the highest, and the fresh mass of MC and LS was significantly increased by 20.4% and 58.4%, respectively. 3) Weed density under the treatment of MC and LS was significantly reduced by 34.0% and 25.8%. Compared with LS, MC significantly increased the control effect of plant and fresh mass by 21.7% and 63.4%, respectively. In conclusion, film cultivation methods could improve the environment for root growth, reduce weed density, improve weed control effect, and promote growth process and substance accumulation, but could promote the bolting of A. sinensis in early phase.",

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 4 per group) had either sham operation or UUO alone, with A&A (combined aqueous and ethanol extract equivalent to 2.1 g dried herbs), with Enalapril (in drinking water at 200 mg/mL) or with both treatments. Kidney and liver were collected for protein extraction or fixed for histologic stains, immunohistochemistry (IHC), microscopy. Enalapril or A&A individually were antifibrotic. Transforming growth factor-beta1, fibroblast activation, collagen deposition, macrophage accumulation and tubular cell apoptosis were all decreased. The combination of the two drugs was significantly more effective than Enalapril alone in reducing tumor necrosis factor-alpha, collagen accumulation, activation of fibroblasts, and tubular cell apoptosis. In conclusion, Enalapril with A&A significantly decreased tubulointerstitial fibrosis to a greater extent than treatment with Enalapril alone. Further studies focusing on the isolation of the active constituents of A&A and the clinical application of the combination of ACEi plus A&A are warranted to determine the value of this treatment in humans.",

            "content": "Angelica sinensis (AS) is an important medicinal plant, and volatile oil is the main pharmacologically active ingredient. This study was aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of the volatile oil of A. sinensis (VOAS) and explore its potential anti-inflammatory mechanism by plasma metabolomics approach. Rat acute inflammation was induced by subcutaneous injection of carrageenan in hind paws. Paw edema, histamine (HIS) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were detected. Then, we analyzed plasma metabolic profiling of acute inflammation and performed pathway analysis on the metabolite markers reversed after VOAS administration and further integration of metabolic networks. The results showed that VOAS could alleviate the paw edema and decrease plasma HIS and 5-HT levels. Fourteen metabolite markers of acute inflammation were screened, and the levels were all reversed to different degrees after VOAS administration. These metabolite markers mainly related to linoleic acid metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. In metabolic networks, glycine and arachidonic acid were node molecules. It indicated that VOAS could significantly inhibit systemic inflammatory response triggered by acute local stimulation and it exerted anti-inflammatory activity mainly through regulating the disturbed metabolic networks centered on glycine and arachidonic acid.",

            "content": "In this study, two pathogenesis-related (PR) class 10 protein isoforms, ASPR-1 and ASPR-2, were purified from fresh roots of the Chinese medicinal plant Angelica sinensis (A. sinensis) using 80% ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G50 gel filtration chromatography, and DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography. The molecular masses of ASPR-1 and ASPR-2 were estimated to be 16.66 kDa and 16.46 kDa, respectively, using sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The isoforms are both glycoproteins containing glycosyl contents of 1.8% (ASPR-1) and 3.4% (ASPR-2). The two isoforms were predominantly present as monomers, but they partially dimerized in solution. The 15 N-terminal amino acids of ASPR-1 were determined to be GIQKTEVEAPSTVSA, with significant sequence homology to certain PR-10 proteins. ASPR-2 was also identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis to be a PR-10 protein. The isoforms both exhibited ribonuclease (RNase) activity, with ASPR-2 having higher specific activity (128.85 U mg-1) than ASPR-1 (68.67 U mg-1). The isoforms had the same optimal temperature of 50 °C but different optimal pH values of 5.0 (ASPR-1) and 6.0 (ASPR-2). The RNase activities of the isoforms were both stable for 30 min at 50 °C, rapidly decreasing at higher or lower processing temperatures. However, ASPR-1 retained higher residual activity (89.4%-80.9%) than ASPR-2 (74.3%-67.9%) at temperatures from 40 °C to 60 °C. These results provide additional information to enrich the current knowledge of poorly annotated A. sinensis proteins.",

Furthermore, the effects on the estrous cycle in rat were investigated. The results obtained have shown that the administration of a standardized ethanol extract in ovariectomized rats exhibited a stimulation of the uterine histoarchitecture, a significant cornification in the vaginal epithelium and a reduction of serum LH concentration showing the estrogenic nature of the extract. Furthermore, the administration of the extract in intact female rats provoked a significant modification of the vaginal smear in 67% of treated rats. The estrous cycle thus modified was characterized by a prolonged estrus stage with a temporary reduction of the regular cyclicity.",

            "content": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) involves the dysregulation of intestinal mucosal immunity and imbalance between the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the endogenous anti-oxidants. While the protective effects of Angelica sinensis (AS) polysaccharides on neutrophil-dependent gastric mucosal damage have been reported, similar protective effects on UC are still uncertain. Hence our study aimed to investigate the effects of AS polysaccharides on rats with acute UC induced by 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (DNBS) evaluated after 24 h. Intrarectal injection of DNBS significantly reduced the glutathione (GSH) content, increased malondialdehyde concentration and raised the amount of apoptotic cells in colon tissues, which were related to oxidative stress and attenuated by AS polysaccharides pretreatment (5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml). These findings suggest that oxidative stress and GSH depletion are highly associated with the pathological mechanism of UC, and the protective effects of AS polysaccharides are closely related to the prevention of oxidative stress, which may occur during neutrophil infiltration in the pathological process of UC.",

AP consisted of rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, glucose, galactose with the molar ratio of 1.00:4.54:2.98:11.09:7.45. Cell proliferation results showed that proliferation of total spleen cells, macrophages and T cells were promoted by the action of AP. The treatment of AP increased the production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma, while that of IL-4 was decreased. RT-PCR analysis displayed that the IL-2 and IFN-gamma gene expression were enhanced but the IL-4 gene expression was decreased. Some differences in cytokines secretion pattern were also detected, the expression of IFN-gamma was rapidly augmented while that of IL-2 responded later. The flow cytometry results showed that the percentage of CD4(+)T cell in total spleen cells was remarkably increased by AP, while that of CD8(+)T cell was slightly decreased. In conclusion, AP has immunomodulatory activity by regulating expression of Th1 and Th2 related cytokines. The time-effect relation of cytokines response also suggests that macrophages and natural killer cells involved in nonspecific immunity were primary activated, and helper T cell were secondarily affected by AP.",

The results showed that the FRAS and RAS had certain enriching blood activities(P<0.05). The contribution degree of the FRAS and RAS to enriching blood activities of each common peaks were determined by regression coefficient. Among them, 4 common peaks contributed significantly to the effect of enriching blood activities, P1(unknown), P2(unknown), P7(ferulic acid), and P11(senkyunolide A) respectively.

Modern researches indicate that phthalides, organic acids and their esters, polysaccharides are main chemical components related to the bioactivities and pharmacological properties of Danggui. Some of them, such as Z-ligustilide and ferulic acid, are selected as marker compounds to evaluate the quality of Danggui frequently. Because of the diversity of chemical structures and characters of these components, analytical methods of Danggui are various, including GC-MS, HPLC-DAD-MS, TLC, CE-DAD, and so on. Besides that, the development of analytical technology makes the quality control of Danggui more effective and reliable. Quality evaluation is from single or several components' analysis to fingerprinting, or in combination. Furthermore, bioactive components screening of Danggui has also attracted much attention, which will help us evaluate the selected marker components to some extent. In this paper, the literatures about the major phytoconstituents of Danggui, quality control and bioactive components screening methods have been reviewed. Main attention is given to the different methodologies developed to perform chemical analysis, including separation, detection and identification.",

We determined the protective effect of the extract of Ligusticum chuanxiong and Angelica sinensis (ELCAS) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECV304) damage induced by hydrogen peroxide. ECV304 cells were pre-treated with ELCAS and exposed to 5 mM hydrogen peroxide. The results show that ELCAS dose- and time-dependently protected ECV304 cells against hydrogen peroxide damage and suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The decrement of ROS may be associated with increased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Western blot analysis revealed that ELCAS significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK and promoted eNOS expression. These observations indicate that ELCAS protected ECV304 cells against hydrogen peroxide damage by enhancing the antioxidative ability, activating ERK and eNOS signaling pathway. Our data also provide new evidence of Ligusticum chuanxiong and Angelica sinensis in preventing both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.",

            "content": "Background:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Angelica root is the dry root of the Umbelliferae plant Angelica sinensis (oliv) Diels. Angelica organic acid (OA) is the main active ingredient in Angelica sinensis, and it exerts potential anti-atherosclerotic effects by preventing Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) induced endothelial injury. To study the protective effects of OA on ox-LDL-induced HUVECs autophagic flux dysfunction and inflammatory injury.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      OA were isolated by water extraction and alcohol precipitation, and then the content of ferulic acid (FA) in the OA was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The ox-LDL-induced endothelial injury model was established. The effect of ferulic acid on the survival of Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HVUECs) was detected by CCK-8 assay. HUVECs were pretreated with different concentrations of OA (20 μmol/L, 40 μmol/L, and 80 μmol/L), and Western Blot was used to detect the expressions of LC3II, p62, MCP-1, VCAM-1 and LOX-1. The autophagosomes in HUVECs were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      20 μmol/L OA could increase the expression of LC3II and decrease the expression of p62, MCP-1, VCAM-1 and LOX-1. The results of TEM showed that angelica organic acids promoted cell organelle degradation in autolysosomes.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      OA could reduce inflammation, protect endothelial cells and play an anti-atherosclerotic role by enhancing the autophagy flux of damaged endothelial cells, in which FA the major active ingredient of OA played a major role.",

            "content": "Purpose:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Herbs with \"blood-activating\" properties by traditional medicine theory often raise concerns for their possible anti-platelet or anticoagulation effects based on reports from in vitro studies. Such herbs have been implicated for bleeding manifestations based on only anecdotal reports. In particular, the combination of such herbs with anti-platelet agents is often empirically advised against despite lack of good clinical evidence. Here we studied 3 commonly used herbal preparations Curcuma longa, Angelica sinensis and Panax ginseng on their respective anti-platelet and anticoagulation effect, alone and in combination with aspirin.,Study design:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 25 healthy volunteers for each herbal preparation.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Each subject underwent 3 phases comprising of herbal product alone, aspirin alone and aspirin with herbal product, where each phase lasted for 3 weeks with 2 weeks of washout between phases. PT/APTT, platelet function by light transmission aggregometry and thrombin generation assay by calibrated automated thrombogram were measured at baseline and after each phase. Information on adverse reaction including bleeding manifestations was collected after each phase.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      On the whole there was no clinically relevant impact on platelet and coagulation function. With the exception of 5 of 24 subjects in the Curcuma longa group, 2 of 24 subjects in the Angelica sinensis group and 1 of 23 subjects in the Panax ginseng group who had an inhibition in arachidonic-acid induced platelet aggregation, there was no effect of these 3 herbals products on platelet aggregation by other agonists. Combination of these herbal products with aspirin respectively did not further aggravate platelet inhibition caused by aspirin. None of the herbs impaired PT/APTT or thrombin generation. There was no significant bleeding manifestation.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      This study on healthy volunteers provides good evidence on the lack of bleeding risks of Curcuma longa, Angelica sinensis and Panax ginseng either used alone or in combination with aspirin.",

            "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a critical public health and socioeconomic problem worldwide. The herb pair Astragali Radix (AR)-Radix Angelica Sinensis (RAS) is a common prescribed herbal formula or is added to other Chinese medicine prescriptions for traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore the active ingredients and action targets of AR-RAS based on the combined methods of network pharmacology prediction and experimental verification. Furthermore, the corresponding potential mechanisms of \"multicomponents, multitargets, and multipathways\" were disclosed. Methods. A network pharmacology approach including ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) filter analysis, target prediction, known therapeutic targets collection, Gene Ontology (GO), pathway enrichment analysis, and network construction was used in this study. Further verification experiments were performed to reveal the therapeutic effects of AR-RAS in a rat model of TBI. Results. The comprehensive systematic approach was to successfully identify 14 bioactive ingredients in AR-RAS, while 33 potential targets hit by these ingredients related to TBI. Based on GO annotation analysis, multiple biological processes were significantly regulated by AR-RAS. In addition, 89 novel signaling pathways (P<0.05) underlying the effects of AR-RAS for TBI treatment were identified by DAVID. The neurotrophin signaling pathway was suggested as the major related pathway targeted by AR-RAS to improve axonal growth. The animal experiment confirmed that AR-RAS significantly induced tissue recovery and improved neurological deficits on the 14th day (P<0.01). Treatment with AR-RAS markedly reduced the protein and mRNA expression level of NogoA in the hippocampus of TBI rats. Conclusion. Our work illuminates the \"multicompounds, multitargets, and multipathways\" curative action of AR-RAS in the treatment of TBI by network pharmacology. The animal experiment verifies the effects of AR-RAS on neurological function improvement and axonal outgrowth via downregulation of NogoA expression, providing a theoretical basis for further research on treatment of TBI.",

            "content": "Angelica sinensis is a highly valued medicinal herb, known as female ginseng that is widely cultivated in China. Although A. sinensis is in great demand due to its multiple medicinal and food applications, its early bolting rate (almost 40%) seriously affects crop quality. To better understand its flowering mechanism, cDNA-amplified RFLP analysis was employed to look for gene expression differences between flower bud and shoot apical meristem tissues. Sixty-four primer sets were used, with each primer set amplified to 60 transcript-derived fragments. Some transcript-derived fragments were expressed only in the flower bud. After cloning, sequencing and a homology search, 46 distinct sequences were obtained; 26 of these were found to have homologous sequences in databases. These included trans-caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase, 15-cis-zeta-carotene isomerase, isoamylase, and calmodulin-binding protein. These genes are closely related to pollen germination and pollen tube growth, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, and other metabolic pathways. Confirmation of differential expression of 10 sequences was obtained by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, showing higher expression levels in flower buds.",

In this study, we determined and compared the contents of polysaccharides, total coumarins, ferulic acid, total phenols, total flavonoids, chlorogenic acid, protein, and amino acids, and the composition of volatile oil in RVT and RAS. Biological activities, including antioxidants, scavenging of nitrite, inhibition of tyrosinase, thrombin, and coagulation FXa, were comparatively evaluated. Results showed that RVT contains more polysaccharides, phenols, flavonoids, proteins, glutamic acid, and lysine as compared to RAS. Among volatile compounds, 14 species are similar, and 20 species are different in RVT and RAS. Overall, among volatile compounds, the content of 3-N-Butylphthalide was higher, whereas the content of ligustilide was lower in RVT volatile oil. A significant difference was reported in the bioactivity of RVT and RAS. The biological activity of RVT had higher antioxidant, nitrite scavenging, and tyrosinase inhibitory activities, whereas it showed much lower thrombin and FXa inhibitory activities. Correlation analysis showed that the antioxidant, nitrite scavenging, and tyrosinase inhibitory activities were related to the phenol and flavonoid content, whereas the thrombin and FXa inhibitory activities were related to ferulic acid and volatile oil content. This study presents a comparative analysis of RAS and RVT's chemical compositions of antioxidant, nitrite-scavenging, inhibition of tyrosinase, thrombin, and coagulation FXa activities. It was found that both RVT and RAS have their unique advantages, and RVT has the potential to be utilized as functional foods, cosmetics, and medical products.",

            "content": "Two proteins of similar molecular weight (named as ASPR-C-1 and ASPR-C-2) from the crude drug of Angelica sinensis were purified and characterized by 80% ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-50 gel filtration chromatography, and DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography. The molecular weight of ASPR-C-1 and ASPR-C-2 on SDS-PAGE was 17.33 kDa and 17.18 kDa, respectively. They were mainly monomeric in solution, but partially formed dimers and they were glycoproteins with glycosyl content of 2.6% and 8.2%, respectively. Both ASPR-C-1 and ASPR-C-2 were identified to be members of pathogenesis-related 10 family of proteins by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and have ribonuclease activities with the specific activity of 73.60 U/mg and 146.76 U/mg, respectively. The optimum pH of the two isoforms was similar, at about 5.6, while their optimum temperatures were different. The optimum temperature of ASPR-C-1 was 50 ℃, and that of ASPR-C-2 was 60 ℃. Both isoforms presented highest thermal stability at 60 ℃. However, ASPR-C-2 was more thermotolerant than ASPR-C-1. The latter was rapidly inactivated and retained only about 20% residual activity while the former still maintained about 80% of its original activity at a higher treatment temperature (80 to 100 ℃). In addition, Fe²⁺ had an activating effect on the ribonuclease activities of two isoforms while Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Zn²⁺, Mn²⁺, Ag⁺, Cu²⁺, EDTA (Elhylene diamine tetraacetic acid), dithiothreitol and sodium dodecylsulphate showed different degrees of inhibition of the enzyme activities.

            "content": "Radix Angelica sinensis is a Chinese medicinal herb that has been used extensively in the East for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Angiogenesis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CVDs. We hypothesized that Radix A. sinensis may contain angiogenesis modulators. In the current study, we investigated the effects of a volatile oil of Radix A. sinensis (VOAS) and n-butylidenephthalide (BP), one of the bioactive components in VOAS, on angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. The results suggested that VOAS exerted anti-angiogenic effects by inhibiting human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation, migration and capillary-like tube formation on Matrigel. BP was also shown to be anti-angiogenic and its mechanisms were through inhibition of cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis. Western blotting analysis indicated that the anti-angiogenic actions of BP were associated with the activation of p38 and ERK 1/2 but not SAPK/JNK and Akt signaling pathways. Further investigations showed that BP inhibited endothelial sprouting in an ex vivo mouse aortic ring model and was a potent inhibitor of the development of zebrafish subintestinal vessels in vivo. Our data using the volatile oil contrast with previous findings, which showed an aqueous extract of Radix A. sinensis was pro-angiogenic. This highlights the importance of identifying pro- and anti-angiogenic substances in Radix A. sinensis, not only for the development of novel angiogenesis modulators for the treatment of CVDs, but also to ensure the proper use of Radix A. sinensis as a nutraceutical.",

            "content": "A reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed for quantifying E-ligustilide (1) and Z-ligustilide (3) in the roots of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels with confirmation using UV, atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) MS and APCI-MS-MS techniques. Based on the UV spectra of compounds 1, E-butylidenephthalide (2), 3 and Z-butylidenephthalide (4), the absorption at 350 nm was chosen as measuring wavelength in which baseline separation of compounds 1 and 3 could be obtained but avoided the interference of compounds 2 and 4. The identity of compounds 1 and 3 in samples were unambiguously determined by the respective quasi-molecular ions ([M+H]+) in APCI-MS. According to the stability data, acetonitrile was chosen for the preparation of standard solutions in order to minimize the isomerization of compound 3. Compounds 1 and 3 were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed in seven samples of the roots of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, Angelica acutiloba Kitagawa, Angelica acutiloba Kitagawa var. sugiyamae Hikino and the rhizome of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. Analysis of an extract from a sample root of Angelica gigas Nakai using LC-MS for the first time could not detect the presence of ligustilide in this herb. The overall analytical procedure is rapid and reproducible which is considered suitable for quantitative analysis of large number of samples.",

BD model mice were established by injecting N-acetylphenylhydrazine (APH) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) (ip). The aqueous extract of AS was administered at three dose of 20, 10, or 5 g/kg b. wt. orally for 7 consecutive days before/after APH and CTX administration. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combined with pattern recognition method and 2D gel electrophoresis (2-DE) proteomics were performed in this study to discover the underlying hematopoietic regulation mechanisms of AS on BD mouse model.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Unlike in the control group, the HSP90 and arginase levels increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the BD group, but the levels of carbonic anhydrase, GAPDH, catalase, fibrinogen, GSTP, carboxylesterase and hem binding protein in the BD group decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Unlike the levels in the BD group, the levels of these biomarkers were regulated to a normal state near the control group in the ASM group. Unlike in the control group, l-alanine, arachidonic acid, l-valine, octadecanoic acid, glycine, hexadecanoic acid, l-threonine, butanoic acid, malic acid, l-proline and propanoic acid levels increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the BD group, the levels of d-fructose in the BD group decreased significantly (p < 0.05). The relative concentrations of 12 endogenous metabolites were also significantly affected by the ASL, ASM, and ASH treatments. Notably, most of the altered BD-related metabolites were restored to normal state after ASM administration.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      AS can promote hematopoietic activities, inhibit production of reactive oxygen species, regulate energy metabolism, increase antiapoptosis, and potentially contribute to the blood enrichment effects of AS against APH- and CTX-induced BD mice.",

Acute inflammation was induced by subcutaneous injection of carrageenan in rats. The levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ), histamine (HIS) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the inflammatory fluid were detected. Principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis models were performed for pattern recognition analysis. After the administration of VOAS, the levels of PGE2 , HIS, and 5-HT returned to levels observed in normal group. According to GC-MS analysis, the intervention of VOAS in rats with acute inflammation induced substantial and characteristic changes in their metabolic profiles. Fourteen metabolite biomarkers, namely, lactic acid, malic acid, citric acid, trans-dehydroandrosterone, aldosterone, linoleic acid, hexadecanoic acid, pregnenolone, octadecenoic acid, myristic acid, l-histidine, octadecanoic acid, arachidonic acid (AA) and l-tryptophan, were detected in the inflammatory fluid. The levels of all biomarkers either increased or decreased significantly in model groups. VOAS possibly intervened in the metabolic process of inflammation by altering histidine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, AA metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism and energy metabolism. Metabonomics was used to reflect an organism's physiological and metabolic state comprehensively, and it is a potentially powerful tool that reveals the anti-acute-inflammatory mechanism of VOAS.",

            "content": "Despite recent advances in antibiotic therapy and intensive care, sepsis remains a widespread problem in critically ill patients. The high mortality from sepsis is in part mediated by bacterial endotoxin, which stimulates macrophages/monocytes to sequentially release early (e.g., tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and interferon-gamma) and late [e.g., high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1)] proinflammatory cytokines. Our discovery of HMGB1 as a late mediator of lethal systemic inflammation has initiated a new field of investigation for the development of experimental therapeutics. A popular Chinese herb, Angelica sinensis (also known as Dang Gui or Dong Quai) has been used traditionally for treating women with gynecological disorders (such as dysmenorrheal and hot flashes). Here we examined the effect of Angelica sinensis extract on endotoxin-induced HMGB1 release in vitro, and explored its therapeutic potential in animal models of lethal endotoxemia and sepsis [induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)] in vivo. We demonstrated that a low-molecular-weight (<10 kDa) fraction of A. sinensis extract significantly attenuated endotoxin-induced HMGB1 release in part through interfering with its cytoplasmic translocation in macrophage cultures. Prophylactic administration of an aqueous extract of A. sinensis significantly attenuated systemic HMGB1 accumulation in vivo, and conferred a dose-dependent protection against lethal endotoxemia. Furthermore, delayed administration of A. sinensis extract beginning 24 h after CLP attenuated systemic HMGB1 accumulation, and significantly rescued mice from lethal sepsis. Taken together, these data suggest that A. sinensis contains water-soluble components that exert protective effects against lethal endotoxemia and experimental sepsis in part by attenuating systemic accumulation of a late proinflammatory cytokine, HMGB1.",

It exhibits various therapeutic effects including neuroprotective, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities. Angelica polysaccharides (APs), bioactive constituents of Angelica have been shown to be responsible for these effects; however, the utility of APs for the treatment of glioma and their mechanism of action remain to be elucidated.,Purpose:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of APs on a glioma cell line and their molecular mechanism of action.,Study design:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      U251 cells were utilized to confirm the effects of APs on glioma.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The human glioblastoma cell line U251 was utilized for both in vitro and in vivo models, in which we tested the effects of APs. Flow cytometry, gene expression analysis, western blotting, and MTT assays were used to elucidate the effects of APs on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The results demonstrated that APs significantly inhibited the growth and proliferation of U251 cells and induced their apoptosis. Furthermore, APs effectively reduced the expression of several cell cycle regulators: cyclins D1, B, and E. The apoptosis suppressor protein Bcl-2 was also downregulated, and the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 increased. Additionally, APs inhibited the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling pathway and stimulated the expression of E-cadherin, thus prohibiting cell growth.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      In conclusion, the results indicate that APs attenuate the tumorigenicity of glioma cells and promote their apoptosis by suppressing the TGF-β signaling pathway. The present study therefore provides evidence of the inhibitory effects of APs against glioma progression, and proposes their potential application as alternative therapeutic agents for glioma.",

LIG (10 or 40 mg/kg) was intragastrically administered to rats once daily for 3 days. Our results showed that LIG significantly and dose-dependently reduced arterial thrombus weight in an arteriovenous shunt thrombosis in rats and platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate in rats ex vivo. Meanwhile, LIG at 10 or 40 mg/kg had no significant effect on coagulation time, including activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time, in rats ex vivo.

The proposed internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) is not sufficient to resolve heavily processed materials. Therefore, a short barcode for the identification of processed materials is urgently needed. In this study, 265 samples of Angelicae sinensis radix and adulterants were collected. The ITS2 region was sequenced, and based on one single nucleotide polymorphism(SNP) site unique to Angelica sinensis, a nucleotide signature consisting of 37-bp (5'-aatccgcgtc atcttagtga gctcaaggac ccttagg-3') was developed. It is highly conserved and specific within Angelica sinensis while divergent among other species. Then, we designed primers (DG01F/DG01R) to amplify the nucleotide signature region from processed materials. 15 samples procured online were analysed. By seeking the signature, we found that 7 of them were counterfeits. 28 batches of Chinese patent medicines containing Danggui were amplified. 19 of them were found to contain the signature, and adulterants such as Ligusticum sinense, Notopterygium incisum, Angelica decursiva and Angelica gigas were detected in other batches. Thus, this nucleotide signature, with only 37-bp, will broaden the application of DNA barcoding to identify the components in decoctions, Chinese patent medicines and other products with degraded DNA.",

GC analysis showed two bioactive alkylphthalides, Z-ligustilide and n-butylidenephthalide (BP) were the major compounds detected in the bioactive fractions, and were absent in non-bioactive fractions. Our results indicate that Z-ligustilide and BP are the main constituents responsible for the anti-endothelial properties of VOAS. This rapid and reliable approach in preserving sample activity while isolating and identifying its active compounds suggests that this protocol can be a powerful tool for drug discovery from natural products.",

            "content": "The roots of Angelica sinensis (Danggui), a traditional Chinese medicine, have been used for invigorating blood circulation for over 2000 years in China. Three common species of Angelica roots are found in Asia: A. sinensis from China, A. acutiloba from Japan, and A. gigas from Korea. By using a molecular genetic approach, the 5S-rRNA spacer domains of the three species of Angelica were amplified, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. Diversity in DNA sequences among various species was found in their 5S-rRNA spacer domains, which could serve as markers for authentic identification of Angelica roots. In chemical analyses, the main constituents of Angelica roots including ferulic acid and Z-ligustilide were determined by HPLC; roots of A. sinensis were clearly distinct in that they contained approximately 10-fold higher levels of ferulic acid and Z-ligustilide as compared to roots of A. acutiloba and A. gigas. In addition, the amounts of main constituents in roots of A. sinensis varied according to different regions of cultivation and different methods of preservation. The chemical profile determined by HPLC therefore could serve as a fingerprint for quality control of Angelica roots.",

            "content": "Increasing evidence has shown that β-amyloid (Aβ) induces hyperphosphorylation of tau and contributes to Aβ toxicity. Recently, tau hyperphosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) activation has been emphasized as one of the pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is known as an upstream element of GSK-3β. The inhibitory control of GSK-3β, via the PI3K/Akt pathway, is an important mechanism of cell survival. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of Angelica sinensis (AS), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, against Aβ(1-42) toxicity in cultured cortical neurons and also the potential involvement of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signal pathway. We revealed that AS extract significantly attenuated Aβ(1-42) -induced neurotoxicity and tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple AD-related sites in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneously, it increased the levels of phospho-Ser(473) -Akt and down-regulated GSK-3β activity by PI3K activation. The neuroprotective effects of AS extract against Aβ(1-42) -induced neurotoxicity and tau hyperphosphorylation were blocked by LY294002 (10 μM), a PI3K inhibitor. In addition, AS extract reversed the Aβ(1-42) -induced decrease in phosphorylation cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB), which could be blocked by the PI3K inhibitor. These results suggest that AS-mediated neuroprotection against Aβ toxicity is likely mediated by the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signal pathway.",

Totally 50 male Waster rats were randomly divided into normal control group, C-ASVO group, J-ASVO group, T-ASVO group and Y-ASVO group, with 10 rats in each group. The normal group was given isovolumetric 0.5% polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester（Tween-80）, while the other groups were given 0.176 mL•kg⁻¹ different processed volatile oils from AS. Drugs were given for 3 successive days. The urine was collected at 48 h with metabolic cages. GC-MS was employed to detect the metabolic fingerprint of rat urine in different times. Principal component analysis(PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis(OPLS-DA) were adopted for a multivariate statistical analysis. Metabolites with potential differences were selected based on the results of variable importance in the projection(VIP) and t test. The metabolic pathway analysis(MetPA) database was built for different metabolites' metabolic pathways. The results showed that compared with the normal group, 31 kinds of endogenous metabolites in the different processed volatile oils from AS groups change significantly(P<0.05). And there were differences in normal rat urine metabolites among the different processed volatile oils from AS, of which the influence degree of J-ASVO was slightly stronger than C-ASVO, T-ASVO, and Y-ASVO. Therefore, the metabolism effect may be focused on energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and glucose metabolism. This study focused on metabolism and mechanism of different processed volatile oils from AS, and provided new ideas for pharmacological actions of traditional Chinese medicines.",

            "content": "Cisplatin (CisPt), a chemotherapeutic drug applied against solid tumors, is highly detrimental to the kidney. The risk of acute kidney injury implies adequate patient hydration to ensure sufficient diuresis; this strategy, now implemented in clinical practice, remains however incompletely satisfactory. New pharmacological approaches relying on the discovery of bioactive compounds need to be developed. Based on previous studies reporting renoprotective activities for extracts of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels roots, three of its major active compounds, ferulic acid, Z-ligustilide and E-ligustilide, were investigated for possible alleviation of CisPt-induced nephrotoxicity. Five phenomena involved in acute kidney injury and subsequent fibrosis were investigated: (i) modulation of cell survival via reduction of the apoptosis rate; (ii) reduction of oxidative stress; (iii) improvement of tubular regeneration capacities through proliferation and migration; (iv) limitation of extracellular matrix and collagen deposition; and (v) prevention of the dedifferentiation processes via the β-catenin pathway. Ferulic acid emerged as the most potent compound for alleviating cell death and collagen deposition, and for enhancing cell regeneration capacities. It also partially inhibited the β-catenin pathway, but was ineffective in lowering oxidative stress. Z- and E-ligustilides, however, were effective for limiting the oxidative stress, but only moderately affected other parameters. Ferulic acid appears to be a promising nephroprotective drug lead deserving further preclinical investigation.",

            "content": "The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is severely increasing with the aging. It has been proposed that NSCs (neural stem cells) help to control aging, but the mechanisms responsible remain unclear. Angelica polysaccharide is an active ingredient of Angelica sinensis in traditional Chinese medicine, which possesses versatile pharmacological activities including anti-oxidative and anti-aging effects. In this study, D-gal (D-galactose) was used to construct an aging model of Nestin-GFP transgenic mice brain tissues and NSCs. Mouse model was subcutaneously injected with D-gal, as we observed that mice consistently displayed acceleration of aging-like behavior change, energy metabolism decreased, the expression of aging-related genes was up-regulated. Conversely, aging retardation was achieved in Nestin-GFP mice Induced by D-gal that was locally injected with ASP (Angelica polysaccharide). Mechanistically, we isolated and cultured NSCs in vitro. ASP protected NSCs by increasing the cell proliferation; decreasing the number of SA-β-gal stained neurons; increasing the activity of SOD(superoxide dismutase) and T-AOC(total antioxidant capacity), decreasing the content of MDA(malondialdehyde); decreasing the levels of IL-1b,IL-6,TNF-a and ROS; and down-regulated the expression of cellular senescence associated genes p53, p21 in the aging NSCs. In conclusion, ASP can delay aging speed by protecting NSCs and promote neurogenesis by enhancing the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity, up-regulation of p53/p21 signaling pathway. As to provide theoretical basis for treatment for brain aging related diseases, add new scientific connotation for \"qi and blood theory\" and \"supplement blood and delay aging\" of Traditional Chinese Medicine.",

Taking 2-year continuous cropping A. sinensis and its rhizosphere soil as test objects, with control (without any pesticides, micro-fertilizer, CK), pesticides groups (15% chlorpyrifos and 50% carbendazim, N), and DZF-363 (DZF) treatments, microbial community structure, and urease and phosphatase activities in rhizosphere soil were figured out by high throughput sequencing and colorimetric method. The results showed that the yield of DZF-363 group was 18.8% higher than CK and 6.8% higher than N. The root rot disease index in the DZF was reduced, with a control effectiveness of 52.0%. The activities of urease, neutral phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase in rhizosphere soil were significantly increased during the growing season, and the urease acti-vity increased by 52.4%, 13.9%, 10.3%, neutral phosphatase activity by 15.5%, 10.2%, 10.3%, alkaline phosphatase activity by 10.3%, 4.4%, 4.0% compared with CK during seedling and middle, and harvesting stages, respectively.

The proportion of unidentified Bacillibacteria and Actinobacteria was larger in DZF than in the CK and N groups. The Shannon index was significantly increased by DZF. There was positive correlation between Shannon and Simpson indices with the yield of A. sinensis, while negative correlation with the root rot disease. Therefore, the application of DZF-363 could strongly improve the diversity of soil bacteria in the rhizosphere, alter the soil bacterial community structure and rhizosphere soil urease and phosphatase activities, reduce the occurrence of root rot diseases, and thus increase the yield.",

            "content": "An analytical method of high performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) was developed to simultaneously separate and identify the component monosaccharides of Angelica sinensis polysaccharide fractions (APFs), named APF1, APF2 and APF3. The predominant sugars in APFs were identified as arabinose, glucose, rhamnose, galactose and galacturonic acid as well as trace amount of mannose and glucuronic acid, and the fractionation altered significantly the distribution of component monosaccharides in APFs. APF3 was the most active fraction to effectively inhibit H(2)O(2)-caused decrease of cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and malondialdehyde (MDA) formation, and also reduced H(2)O(2)-caused decline of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) depletion (p<0.05), followed by APF2 and APF1 in decreasing order. Furthermore, it was found that APFs (100 microg/ml) could protect macrophages by inhibiting the release of excess NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by high concentrations of H(2)O(2) (0.8-1.6 mM).",

However, the holistic therapeutic effects and the mechanism underlying such effects of the volatile oil of A. sinensis (VOAS) are not yet well understood. Here, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabonomic study was conducted to explore the significantly altered metabolites for better understanding of VOAS and to assess the integral efficacy of VOAS on a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation rat model. Principal component analysis was used to investigate the global metabonomic alterations and to evaluate the therapeutic effects of VOAS in rats. Clear separations were observed in the comparison of the metabolite profiles of the normal control (NC) group, the LPS-stimulated group (MI), the VOAS group, and the dexamethasone (Dex) group. VOAS exerted therapeutic effects on the LPS-stimulated group, which were in accordance with the results of cytokine analyses and blood physiobiochemical assay. Furthermore, a total of 20, 17, and 22 metabolites distributed in 27 metabolic pathways were respectively identified in plasma, liver, and lung samples as significantly altered metabolites of MI, VOAS, Dex, and NC of the same background. Network analysis revealed that glycine, glutamate, malic acid, succinate, arachidonic acid, glycerol, galactose, and glucose were hub metabolites of the inflammation correlation network. Results indicated that VOAS exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect by adjusting the Krebs cycle, improving the glucose content, and restoring the fatty acid metabolism.",

Both mRNAs from the normal liver tissue and the liver tissue from the mice with hepatic immunological injury or that pretreated with GdCl(3) or ASP were reversely transcribed to cDNAs with the incorporation of fluorescent dUTP to prepare the hybridization probes. The mixed probes were hybridized to the cDNA microarray.

For each kind of tumor model, three experimental groups were respectively given AP-0 at doses of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg by ip once a day for 10 days. Positive control groups were respectively given Cy at a dose of 30 mg/kg for S180 and leukemia L1210, and 5-FU at a dose of 20 mg/kg for EAC. On d 11, mice bearing S180 were sacrificed and the masses of tumors, spleens and thymus weighed. The average living days of mice bearing EAC and of mice bearing L1210 were observed, and the rates of life prolongation of each treatment were calculated, respectively. The inhibitory effects of APs on hepatoma invasion and metastasis in vitro were investigated by employing human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HHCC) with the Matrigel invasion chamber, adhesion to extracellular matrix and chemotatic migration tests, respectively.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      AP-0 had no obviously inhibitory effect on the growth of S180, but it could significantly decrease the thymus weights of the mice bearing S180.

The aim of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic properties of ferulic acid (FA), a main bioactive constituent in both RAS and RLC, between normal and blood deficiency syndrome animals, and to investigate the influence of compatibility of RAS and RLC on the pharmacokinetic of FA. The blood deficiency rats were induced by injecting 2% Acetyl phenylhydrazine (APH) on the first day, every other day, to a total of five times, at the dosage of 100, 50, 50, 30, 30 mg/kg body mass, respectively. Quantification of FA in rat plasma was achieved by using a simple and rapid HPLC method. Plasma samples were collected at different time points to construct pharmacokinetic profiles by plotting drug concentration versus time, and estimate pharmacokinetic parameters. Between normal and blood deficiency model groups, both AUC((0-) (t) ()) and C(max) of FA in blood deficiency rats after RAS-RLC extract administration increased significantly (P < 0.05), while clearance (CL) decreased significantly. Among three blood deficiency model groups, t(1/2α), V(d), AUC((0-) (t) ()) and AUC((0-∞)) all increased significantly in the RAS-RLC extract group compared with the RAS group. The results indicated that FA was absorbed better and eliminated slower in blood deficiency rats; RLC could significantly prolong the half-life of distribution, increase the volume of distribution and the absorption amount of FA of RAS in blood deficiency rats, which may be due to the synergic action when RAS and RLC were used together to treat blood deficiency syndrome.",

            "content": "With the growing global popularity of traditional medicine and natural drugs， especially in Southeast Asia， the quality of traditional Chinese medicines （TCMs） has attracted the attention of regulators. China's major TCM export destinations， such as South Korea， Japan， and Europe， have formulated strict maximum residue limits （MRLs） of pesticides in TCMs. Therefore， a sensitive and high-throughput method for the simultaneous determination of 101 pesticide residues in Platycodonis radix and extracts of Angelica sinensis was established， involving gel permeation chromatography （GPC） coupled with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry （GC-ITMS）. In this method， the samples were first ground into fine powder and extracted twice with 20 mL acetonitrile in an ultrasonic cleaner for 30 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 6000 r/min， the supernatants were combined and dried at 40 ℃ using a rotary vacuum evaporator. The residue was re-dissolved in 2 mL ethyl acetate-cyclohexane （1∶1， v/v） and purified by gel permeation chromatography using a 40 cm×20 mm column. The eluent collecting time was optimized as 17-30 min to ensure both the recovery of target compounds and the removal of interferences such as pigments and lipids from the target compounds. The eluent was then dried and re-dissolved with 1 mL toluene for analysis. The 101 pesticide residues were separated using the DB-5MS capillary column and analyzed by ion trap mass spectrometry. The pretreatment conditions and ion trap mass spectrometry parameters were optimized to effectively reduce the interference of complex TCM matrices and greatly improve the quantitative accuracy of the analysis and recovery of the target pesticides. Three spiked levels of 101 pesticides were tested. The average recovery range was 58.3%-108.9% and the relative standard deviations （RSDs） at the three spiked levels （n=10） ranged from 0.4% to 16.5%. The limits of detection （LODs， S/N=3） of the 101 pesticide compounds ranged from 0.2 to 40.0 μg/kg， while the limits of quantification （LOQs， S/N=10） ranged from 0.6 to 120.0 μg/kg， which met the maximum residue limits of China's main TCM export countries and organizations. This rapid analysis method was easy to operate and high throughput， with strong sensitivity and good repeatability. The employment of gel permeation chromatography overcame the drawback of inadequate cleanup of the solid phase extraction column during TCM analysis. The application of ion trap technology further eliminated the interference of matrix impurities and increased the accuracy of the quantitative and qualitative analyses. This method fills the knowledge gap in multiple pesticide residue determination in TCMs using gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry and is a useful and beneficial alternative to current analytical methods of TCMs.",

            "content": "Angelicae Sinensis Radix is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. Pharmacological studies show that Angelicae Sinensis Radix has clear anticoagulant activity. Therefore, in this study, the anticoagulant activity of crude Angelicae Sinensis Radix extracts was investigated by measuring the thrombin times of the extracts. The results revealed that the petroleum ether-soluble fraction of Angelicae Sinensis Radix exhibited significant anticoagulant activity in vitro, and 26 compounds were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection combined with electrospray ionization ion trap time-of-flight multistage mass spectrometry. In addition, 5 prototype constituents, 24 in vivo metabolites in rat urine and 7 prototype constituents, and 9 in vitro metabolites in the rat hepatic S9 incubation system of the petroleum ether-soluble fraction were tentatively identified. All metabolites were found from Angelicae Sinensis Radix for the first time. Among them, 13 (three ferulic acid-related constituents, six senkyunolide D-related constituents, and four senkyunolide F-related constituents) were identified as new metabolites (new compounds). This study is the first to qualitatively characterize the chemical constituents of the potent anticoagulative extract of Angelicae Sinensis Radix and to explore its metabolism. The result is a notable improvement in the discovery of Angelicae Sinensis Radix metabolites, and it provides the chemical basis for the effective forms and pharmacodynamic substances (prototypes, metabolites, or both) of the anticoagulant activity of Angelicae Sinensis Radix.",

The results show that ELCAS significantly inhibited proliferation and protein synthesis of VSMC in a dose and time dependent manner. The cell population assessed by flow cytometry in the G(0)/G(1) phase increased 74% versus 79.8%, concomitant with a decrease in the S phase, 7.4% versus 4.2%, for control versus ELCAS (300 microg/ml). On the other hand, ELCAS significantly increased nitric oxide production of VSMC. The data suggest that ELCAS markedly inhibited VSMC proliferation by arresting G(1) to S progression, which may be associated with nitric oxide production.",

            "content": "Pressurized liquid extraction, one of the most promising and recent sample preparation techniques, offers the advantages of reducing solvent consumption and allowing for automated sample handling. It is being exploited in diverse areas because of its distinct advantages. However, because the extraction is performed at elevated temperatures using PLE, thermal degradation could be a concern. Z-ligustilide, one of the biologically active components in Angelica sinensis, is an unstable compound, which decomposes rapidly at high temperature. In this study, we carried out a comparative study to evaluate PLE as a possible alternative to current extraction methods like Soxhlet and sonication for simultaneous extraction of Z-ligustilide, Z-butylidenephthalide and ferulic acid in A. sinensis. The operating parameters for PLE including extraction solvent, particle size, pressure, temperature, static extraction time, flush volume and numbers of extraction were optimized by using univariate approach coupled with central composite design (CCD) in order to obtain the highest extraction efficiency. Determination of Z-ligustilide, Z-butylidenephthalide and ferulic acid were carried out by means of high performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detector. The results showed that PLE was a simple, high efficient and automated method with lower solvent consumption compared to conventional extraction methods such as Soxhlet and sonication.

            "content": "The pharmacological effects of Angelicae Sinensis Radix from different producing areas are uneven. Accurate identification of its producing areas by computer vision and machine learning(CVML) is conducive to evaluating the quality of Angelicae Sinensis Radix. This paper collected the high-definition images of Angelicae Sinensis Radix from different producing areas using a digital camera to construct an image database, followed by the extraction of texture features based on the grayscale relationship of adjacent pixels in the image. Then a support vector machine(SVM)-based prediction model for predicting the producing areas of Angelicae Sinensis Radix was built. The experimental results showed that the prediction accuracy reached up to 98.49% under the conditions of the model training set occupying 80%, the test set occupying 20%, and the sampling radius(r) of adjacent pixels being 2. When the training set was set to 10%, the prediction accuracy was still over 93%. Among the three producing areas of Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Huzhu county, Qinghai province exhibited the highest error rate, while Heqing county, Yunnan province the lowest error rate. Angelicae Sinensis Radix from Minxian county, Gansu province and Huzhu county, Qinghai province were both wrongly attributed to Heqing county, Yunnan province, while most of those from Huzhu county, Qinghai province were misjudged as the samples produced in Minxian county, Gansu province. The method designed in this paper enabled the rapid and non-destructive prediction of the producing areas of Angelicae Sinensis Radix, boasting high accuracy and strong stability. There were definite morphological differences between Angelicae Sinensis Radix samples from Minxian county, Gansu province and those from Huzhu county, Qinghai province. The wrongly predicted samples from Minxian county, Gansu province and Huzhu city, Qinghai province shared similar morphological characteristics with those from Heqing county, Yunnan province. Most wrongly predicted samples from Heqing county, Yunnan province were similar to the ones from Minxian county, Gansu province in morphological characteristics.",

            "content": "Activity of Chinese Danggui (DG), the processed root of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, is linked to the ferulic acid content but the stability of ferulic acid during extraction for medicinal use is not known. The stabilities of ferulic acid and coniferyl ferulate were evaluated in the extracts of DG using a variety of extraction solvents. These included various combinations and proportions of methanol, water, formic acid, 1 M aqueous hydrochloric acid and 2% sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3) in water. Coniferyl ferulate was found liable to hydrolyze into ferulic acid in neutral, strongly acidic and basic solvents, where heat and water could facilitate this hydrolysis. However, the hydrolysis was relatively resisted in weakly organic acid. Based on the stability evaluation, two new terms, namely: free ferulic acid and total ferulic acid, were suggested and defined. Free ferulic acid refers to the natural content of ferulic acid in herbs. Total ferulic acid means the sum of free ferulic acid plus the amount of related hydrolyzed components. Meanwhile, the high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed to assay free ferulic acid and total ferulic acid in DG using methanol-formic acid (95:5) and methanol-2% NaHCO3 in water (95:5) as extraction solvents, respectively. Ten DG samples were investigated on their contents of free and total ferulic acid. The results indicated that the amount variety of free ferulic acid was larger than that of their counterparts, and the ratio of total ferulic acid to free ferulic acid was 4.07 +/- 2.73 (mean +/- SD, n = 10). The chemical assay of DG using total ferulic acid content would be a better choice to assess the herbal quality and was recommended.",

The activities of various CYP enzymes were determined by HPLC method. Treatment of rats with water extracts or ethanol extracts of DG, CX and DH at daily dosages equivalent to 3 g (dry herbal material)/kg all increased the microsome protein contents and decreased the total CYP levels. The water extract of DG strongly increased the activities of CYP2D6 and 3A and the water extract of DH significantly increased the activity of 2D6. The other water extracts all showed inhibition against CYP isoforms. Only the ethanol extract of DG and DH increased the CYP2D6 and 3A activities, respectively, and the other ethanol extracts all decreased the level of CYP isoforms. All extract treatments had significant effects on CYP isoforms activities, whether induction or inhibition, compared with the blank control. Thus, caution should be paid to possible drug interactions of DG, CX, DH and CYP substrates.",

Diels) or other herbs with similar compositions. The analytical performance of four different extraction methods for the separation of essential oil components have been compared and these include: ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), Soxhlet extraction (SHE) and hydro-distillation extraction (HDE). The results showed that UAE was the most effective extraction method, and the operational parameters of UAE were optimized. 3-Butylphthalide, Z-butylidenephthalide, senkyunolide I, senkyunolide H, E-butylidenephthalide, senkyunolide A, neocnidilide, Z-ligustilide and E-ligustilide were tentatively identified in chromatograms of chuanxiong based on their GC-EI-MS data. Similarity coefficient calculations based on correlation methods have been performed on the GC-MS fingerprints. Using an authentic standard Chuanxiong as the reference, the similarity coefficients between the standard and all other chuanxiong samples ranged from 0.90 to 1.0 (with 1.0 being the perfect match), which as a group can be readily separated from the Angelica samples for which the similarity index against the chuanxiong standard ranged from 0.75 to 0.77. Conversely, when an authentic Angelica standard was used as the reference, the respective similarity coefficients fall in the range of 0.70-0.75 and 0.98-1.00 for the chuanxiong and Angelica sample groups. Our results thus demonstrate that the fingerprinting technique developed in the study can indeed discriminate the two herbs with high reliability.",

Herein, a binary chromatographic fingerprinting analysis method is developed via hydrophilic interaction chromatography and reversed-phase liquid chromatography to obtain more chemical information. Following that, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometry method is furnished to simultaneously detect 17 ingredients of Angelicae Sinensis Radix gathered from six geographic zones in China. Eventually, the principal component analysis is successfully carried out to classify and differentiate the Angelicae Sinensis Radix from different origins, meanwhile the quantitative volcano plots was used to observe the changes of ingredient trends vividly. Accordingly, the proposed binary chromatography and triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry coupled with multivariate statistical analysis can be utilized as a facile and reliable method for origin tracing and quality control of Angelicae Sinensis Radix.",

            "content": "Since the release of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) findings, an increasing number of dietary supplement products specifically targeting women in menopause have appeared in the American marketplace. This growth highlights the need for a critical evaluation of the tolerability and effectiveness of these products. The purpose of this article is to assess the evidence for safety and benefit of botanical monopreparations used for relief of menopause-related symptoms. The Cochrane Library and Medline databases were searched from January 1966 to October 2004, using a detailed list of terms related to botanicals and menopausal symptoms. Studies were considered eligible (1) if they were controlled trials of a botanical monopreparation administered orally for a minimum of 6 weeks to perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with hot flashes and (2) if they included a placebo or comparative treatment arm. Topical preparations, botanical combinations, and dietary interventions, such as soy food or protein, were not included. No language restrictions were imposed on the search. A total of 19 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies indicate that extract of black cohosh (Actaea racemosa L.) improves menopause-related symptoms; however, methodologic shortcomings in the trials were identified. To date, 4 case reports of possible hepatotoxicity have been published, although previous safety reviews suggest that black cohosh is well tolerated and that adverse events are rare when it is used appropriately. The results of 6 clinical studies on soy (Glycine max L.) isoflavone extracts are mixed. Moreover, the composition and dose of soy supplements varies widely across studies, making comparisons and definitive conclusions difficult. One study challenged the long-term safety of high-dose soy isoflavone extract (150 mg/day for 5 years) on the uterine endometrium. Clinical data from 5 controlled trials assessing the efficacy of semipurified isoflavone red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) leaf extracts to reduce hot flash frequency and severity or to relieve symptoms associated with the domains of the Greene Menopausal Symptom Scale are contradictory. The largest study showed no benefit for reducing symptoms associated with menopause for 2 different red clover isoflavone products compared with placebo. No significant adverse events have been reported in the literature. Single clinical trials do not support the use of dong quai (Angelica sinensis L.), ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Mey), or evening primrose seed oil (Oenothera biennis L.) for improving menopausal symptoms. We conclude that black cohosh extracts appear to ease menopausal symptoms; ongoing studies funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will provide more definitive safety and efficacy data. Soy isoflavone extracts appear to have minimal to no effect, although definitive conclusions are difficult given the wide variation in product composition and dose. Long-term safety of higher dosage (150 mg/day) soy isoflavone extracts is uncertain. Semipurified isoflavone red clover leaf extracts have minimal to no effect in reducing menopausal symptoms. Dong quai, ginseng extract, and evening primrose seed oil appear to be ineffective in ameliorating menopausal symptoms at the dosages and in the preparations used in these studies.",

According to Asian tradition, ASR could be processed with the treatment of wine, which subsequently promoted the biological functions of ASR. By chemical and biological assessments, an orthogonal array design was employed here to determine the roles of three variable parameters in the processing of ASR, including oven temperature, baking time, and flipping frequency. The results suggested that oven temperature and baking time were two significant factors, while flipping frequency was a subordinate factor. The optimized condition of processing with wine therefore was considered to be heating in an oven at 80 °C for 90 min with flipping twice per hour. Under the optimized processing conditions, the solubilities of ferulic acid and Z-ligustilide from ASR were markedly increased and decreased, respectively. In parallel, the biological functions of processed ASR were enhanced in both anti-platelet aggregation and estrogenic activation; these increased functions could be a result of the altered levels of ferulic acid and Z-ligustilide in wine-processed ASR. Thus, the chemical and biological assessment of the processed ASR was in full accordance with the Chinese old tradition.",

Three phenolic acids (esters), 6 phthalides were determined by using UPLC-PDA while polysaccharides were determined by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Then the effects of drying methods on the inner qualities of ASR were evaluated through principle components analysis (PCA) combined with the appearance properties after drying. Results showed that the contents of chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid in samples obtained with controlled temperature and humidity drying (CTHD), medium and shortwave infrared drying (MSID) and microwave vacuum drying (MVD) methods were significantly higher than those with primary drying processing(PDP) method and the fresh samples. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that samples processed with CTHD had more similar general chemical properties with those processed with PDP, suggesting that CTHD was appropriate for the modern primary drying processing of ASR. With samples processed with traditional PDP method as reference, the CTHD method was further optimized in the processing parameters for ASR by orthogonal experiment design. Considering the consumption of drying power and time and other parameters, the modern drying parameters for the primary drying processing of ASR were finally optimized as follows: controlled temperature and humidity drying at 40-45 ℃, relative humidity below 25% and target moisture content about 50% in the first stage of drying process, tempering for 12-24 h, and then drying under the conditions of temperature at 50-60 ℃, relative humidity below 20% and fan frequency at 30-40 Hz in the second stage. The study provided the scientific evidence for the selection of appropriate drying method and suitable parameters for the modern primary drying processing of ASR, as well as the beneficial exploration and practice on the formation of technical standard of primary drying processing for roots and rhizomes types herbal medicines.",

The results showed that the content of five components in Angelicae Sinensis Radix was affected by different softening methods and drying temperature, but the thickness of slice had little effect on the content. The best preparation process for Angelicae Sinensis Radix was as follows: Non-medicinal parts were removed; mildewed and rot as well as moth-eaten parts were removed; washed by the flowing drinking water; stacked in the drug pool; moistening method was used for softening, where 125 mL water was sprayed for every 1 kg of herbs every 2.5 h; upper part of herbs covered with clean and moist cotton, and cut into thin slices (1-2 mm) after 15 h moistening until appropriate softness, with disk thickness of 1-2 cm, then received blast drying for 6 h at 55 ℃, and turned over for 2 times during the drying.",

For the purpose of isolating pure 1 and 2, a gentle and rapid two-step countercurrent isolation procedure was developed. From a supercritical CO2 fluid extract of Angelica sinensis roots, the phthalides were isolated with high GC-MS purities of 99.4% for 1 and 98.9% for 2 and consistently lower qHNMR purities of 98.1% and 96.4%, respectively. Taking advantage of molarity-based qHNMR methodology, a time-resolved study of the dynamic changes and residual complexity of pure 1 was conducted. GC-MS and (qH)NMR analysis of artificially degraded 1 provided evidence for the phthalide degradation pathways and optimized storing conditions. Parallel qHNMR analysis led to the recognition of variations in time- and process-dependent sample purity and has impact on the overall assessment of time-dependent changes in complex natural products systems. The study underscores the importance of independent quantitative monitoring as a prerequisite for the biological evaluation of labile natural products such as monomeric phthalides.",

P7 showed the highest fresh weight and dry weight per 1a (100 m2), followed by P6 and TS. However, PP-grown seedlings are prone to bolting, and it is expected the yield can be increased by preventing bolting. In addition, PT satisfied the regulations of JP17 in terms of, for example, dilute ethanol-soluble extract content, total ash content, and acid-insoluble ash content. It was also found that PT has a higher proportion of lateral roots with respect to the total weight than toki produced from traditionally grown seedlings (TT). The total (Z)-ligustilide contents were 0.07% in PT and 0.12% in TT. It was revealed that it is possible to produce toki that satisfies JP17 regulations; moreover, the period required for toki production was shortened by 6 months with PP-grown seedlings.",

However, the mechanism of DC herb-pair in the prevention of liver fibrosis development was still unclear. In the present study, the effects and mechanisms of DC herb-pair on liver fibrosis were examined using network pharmacology and mouse fibrotic model. Based on the network pharmacological analysis of 13 bioactive ingredients found in DC, a total of 46 targets and 71 pathways related to anti-fibrosis effects were obtained, which was associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway, hepatic inflammation and fibrotic response. Furthermore, this hypothesis was verified using carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced fibrosis model. Measurement of liver functional enzyme activities and histopathological examination showed that DC dramatically reduced bile acid levels, inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen deposition caused by CCl4. The increased expression of liver fibrosis markers, such as collagen 1, fibronectin, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and inflammatory factors, such as chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (MCP-1), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-6 in fibrotic mice were significantly downregulated by DC herb-pair through regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathways. Collectively, these results suggest that DC prevents the development of liver fibrosis by inhibiting collagen deposition, decreasing inflammatory reactions and bile acid accumulation, which provides insights into the mechanisms of herb-pair in improving liver fibrosis.",

            "content": "A HPLC method was established for simultaneous determination of two organic acids(chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid) and five phthalides(senkyunolide I, senkyunolide H, senkyunolide A, ligustilide, and butylidenephthalide) in Angelicae Sinensis Radix and its processed products to clarify the underlying material transferring rules. The analysis was performed on a Welch Ultimate C_8 column(4.6 mm×250 mm, 5 μm) with acetonitrile(A)-0.085% phosphoric acid water(B) as the mobile phase in a gradient elution mode at the flow rate of 1.1 mL·min~(-1), the column temperature of 25 ℃, the detection wavelength of 280 nm, and the injection volume of 10 μL. Under these conditions, the content of the above-mentioned seven components was analyzed in 15 batches of Angelicae Sinensis Radix and its processed products, and the transfer rate of each compound was calculated. As a result, in the processed products, the average content of chlorogenic acid was slightly decreased and that of ferulic acid was equivalent to the medicinal materials. The content of senkyunolide I, senkyunolide H, senkyunolide A, and butylidenephthalide showed an increasing trend in the processed products as compared with the medicinal materials. The mass fraction of ligustilide in the medicinal materials was above 0.7%(0.94% on average), meeting the requirement of 0.6% in the Hong Kong Chinese Materia Medica Standards, but was 0.47% on average in the processed products, which was decreased by 50% approximately. Further investigation showed that the content of ligustilide in freshly made processed products of Angelicae Sinensis Radix did not change significantly compared with that in the medicinal materials, indicating that the loss of ligustilide in the processed products mainly occurred in the storage. Therefore, Angelicae Sinensis Radix is suitable for storing in the form of medicinal materials and the freshly made processed products should be used except for special cases. Additionally, it is recommended to control the content of volatile oils or ligustilide in medicinal materials and processed products of Angelicae Sinensis Radix to ensure its effectiveness in clinical medication.",

The results showed that ASR is a healthy food rich in nucleosides, nucleobases and amino acids, especially arginine. The total average content of nucleosides and nucleobases in all ASR samples was 3.94 mg/g, while that of amino acids reached as high as 61.79 mg/g. Principle component analysis showed that chemical profile differences exist between the two groups of ASR samples prepared using different drying methods, and the contents of nutritional compounds in samples dried with the tempering-intermittent drying processing method (TIDM) were generally higher than those dried using the traditional solar processing method. The above results suggest that ASR should be considered an ideal healthy food and TIDM could be a suitable drying method for ASR when taking nucleosides, nucleobases and amino acids as the major consideration for their known human health benefits.",

In this research, we revealed individual differences and localization of (Z)-ligustilide in Toki cultivated and processed under the same conditions. Thirteen Toki samples (dry weight: 68.2 g-132.3 g) were divided and categorized into 13 parts and the (Z)-ligustilide content of each part was quantified. Total (Z)-ligustilide content ranged from 0.08% to 0.22% and the maximum difference between samples was approximately 2.8-fold. In addition, the localization of (Z)-ligustilide was examined. (Z)-Ligustilide content was the highest in lateral root at 0.19%, followed by main root at 0.13%, and the lowest in root head at 0.09%. Furthermore, the content tended to increase as the root became thinner. In particular, the difference in content between the inner side of upper root head (removed 5 mm from the epidermis 0.06%) and the 1.1-3.0 mm in diameter lateral root (0.24%) was largest at approximately 4.1-fold. We revealed that not only differences among individuals but also localization is a factor affecting the quality of Toki. In contrast, individuals with higher root part (main root + lateral root) weight ratio in whole root dry weight had higher (Z)-ligustilide content. The difference in (Z)-ligustilide content among individuals is due to the balance between root head part and root other than head part. It is possible to predict (Z)-ligustilide content from weight ratio of root part to whole root.",

However, owing to its multi-conjugated unstable structure, the compound has poor drug-forming properties. Therefore, we synthesized highly stable colorless needle crystals (known as ligusticum cycloprolactam, LIGc) through the structural modification of LIG. After a stability experiment was conducted at room temperature for four months, no impurity peaks were found by HPLC-DAD analysis, which indicated that LIGc resolved the stability issues of LIG. LIGc was absorbed and eliminated rapidly after intravenous administration (Cmax = 6.42 ± 1.65 mg/L at a dose of 20 mg/kg) and oral administration (Tmax = 0.5 h, Cmax = 9.89 ± 1.62 mg/L at a dose of 90 mg/kg, t1/2z approximately 2.5 h). The absolute oral bioavailability (F) of LIGc was clearly higher than the F of LIG reported in the literature (F, 83.97 % versus 2.6 %). Linear dose-dependent pharmacokinetics were observed after oral administration, with a higher area under the curve (AUC0-t, 22.31 ± 2.88 mg/L*h) observed at 90 mg/kg than that at 45 mg/kg (AUC0-t, 13.673 ± 0.666 mg/L*h). Tissue distribution results indicated that LIGc easily crossed the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and was distributed widely to the main tissues and organs of rats.

            "content": "Nanoparticle-based vaccine delivery systems have been extensively used to promote and induce immune responses to protein antigens. The properties of the nanoparticles, such as size, surface charge, and antigen loading mode, have been proved to significantly influence the adjuvant effect and immunoreactivity of nanoparticle-based vaccine delivery systems. The purpose of the study was to investigate how the surface charge and antigen loading mode of nanoparticles impact the immune responses. In this study, three ovalbumin (OVA)-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles with different surface charges and antigen loading modes were developed. The three nanoparticles were designed as antigen encapsulated with negatively charged (Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP)-PLGA/OVA), antigen encapsulated with polyethylenimine (PEI)-coated (ASP-PLGA/OVA-PEI), and antigen adsorbed on PEI-coated (ASP-PLGA-PEI-OVA) nanoparticles. The Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) was used as the immunopotentiator and encapsulated into three nanoparticles. The results demonstrated that both PEI-coated (positively charged) nanoparticles promoted the antigen escape from the endosome, which led to the cytoplasmic antigen delivery to generate cross presentation, compared to negatively charged nanoparticles. In addition, PEI-coated nanoparticles activated the DCs in lymph nodes 5 days after the primary vaccination. In vivo experiments demonstrated that both antigen-encapsulated nanoparticles induced more potent and long-term antigen-specific antibody responses, compared to that of antigen-adsorbed nanoparticles. Thus, the PEI-coated and antigen-encapsulated nanoparticles (ASP-PLGA/OVA-PEI) as a vaccine adjuvant delivery system have the potential to induce strong and long-term humoral and cellular immune responses.",

Their physical and chemical properties were determined by using the transmission electron microscope (TEM), laser particle size analyzer (DLS) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and their purity and structure by using X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The atomic absorption spectrometric method was performed for quantification of the iron content in different tissues. Histological sections were stained by Prussian blue staining to observe the disposition of magnetic nanoparticles in the liver and kidney. The results showed that both kinds of magnetic nanoparticles possessed small particle size, good dispersion and good magnetic properties. XRD showed the main component of the two magnetic nanoparticles was Fe(3)O(4) crystals, and FTIR proved Fe(3)O(4) was successfully coated by each polysaccharide, respectively. In vivo, Fe(3)O(4)-dextran accumulated in the liver, spleen and lung and Fe(3)O(4)-Angelica polysaccharide only in the spleen and lung. It was concluded that Angelica polysaccharide may be applied as a novel carrier in the preparation of magnetic nanoparticles.",

Research results indicated that the Weibull function can be used to simulate different grades of Angelicae Sinensis Radix low-temperature moisture regain drying process,and the lower the drying temperature,the smaller the grade,and the better the simulation effect. The grade and drying temperature showed a significant effect on the low-temperature moisture regain drying process of Angelicae Sinensis Radix,and the effect of temperature on the relative moisture regain rate of Angelicae Sinensis Radix was greater than the grade. The relative moisture regain rate of different grades of Angelicae Sinensis Radix at 40 ℃ was higher than 55 ℃,and the relative moisture regain rate at 40 ℃ was first class > second class > third class. After drying,the moisture ratio at 40 ℃ was lower than that at 55 ℃; the effect of the grade on the effective diffusion coefficient of dry water was greater than the temperature. Under different conditions of 40 ℃ and 55 ℃ moisture regain,the effective diffusion coefficient of water was between 2. 941 6×10-6-7. 991 5×10-6 and3. 093 8×10-6-8. 483 8×10-6 for different grades. Under the same temperature conditions,the effective diffusion coefficient of water was first class > second class > third class. Therefore,Weibull function can be used to study and simulate the drying characteristics of different grades of Angelicae Sinensis Radix under low-temperature moisture regain conditions,providing experimental basis for the improvement of traditional drying technology of Angelicae Sinensis Radix and the optimization of drying process of different specifications or grades of Angelicae Sinensis Radix.",

The specially designed adaptor with asymmetric strands and terminal modification avoids amplification of non-target DNA sequences. DNA extracted from Angelica sinensis and Panax notoginseng CCMG were ligated with the adaptors and amplified by an adaptor primer and a single universal barcode primer to obtain partial ITS2 sequence. Results showed that various length of DNA fragments within the ITS2 region were amplified and could be used to identify the concerned species.

The prevalence of herbal medicinal product use among menopausal women highlights the need for investigation into these interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefit of herbal medicinal products for the treatment of menopausal symptoms by performing a systematic review of randomized clinical trials.,Design:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Literature searches of four computerized databases were done to identify randomized clinical trials of herbal medicinal products for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Manufacturers of herbal products were contacted, and our own files were also searched. There were no restrictions on the language of publication. Trials were considered if the outcome measures related to the physical or psychological impact of menopause, whether by compendium scores, questionnaires, or women's symptom diaries, excluding studies describing artificially induced menopause. This review was not concerned with biochemical or pathological data.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Eighteen randomized clinical trials that fit our criteria were identified. These studies investigated black cohosh (n = 4), red clover (n = 4), kava (n = 3), dong quai (n = 1), evening primrose oil (n = 1), ginseng (n = 1), and combination products (n = 4). Trial quality was generally good, with 16 of 18 studies scoring 3 or more (maximum 5) on the Jadad Scale.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      There is no convincing evidence for any herbal medical product in the treatment of menopausal symptoms. However, the evidence for black cohosh is promising, albeit limited by the poor methodology of the trials. The studies involving red clover suggest it may be of benefit for more severe menopausal symptoms. There is some evidence for the use of kava, but safety concerns mean this herbal product is not a therapeutic option at present. The evidence is inconclusive for the other herbal medicinal products reviewed.",

In this study, the contents of ferulic acid, volatile oil, polysaccharide, alcohol extract, water extract, moisture, total ash and acid-insoluble ash in 44 batches of ASR from different sources were determined. The entropy weight method was used for objective weighting. With relative correlation(r_i) as a measure, a multi-index comprehensive evaluation model was constructed for the quality of ASR. The results showed that the relative correlation value of 44 batches of ASR ranged from 0.301 9 to 0.662 9. There were certain differences in the quality of ASR from different sources. The ASR S1-S8, traceable and standardized in processing techno-logy, showed a high relative correlation degree and high quality ranking, indicating that the implementation of systemic management of the production chain of Chinese herbal pieces was beneficial to the quality control of ASR. The quality evaluation results of 44 batches of ASR were consistent with those of traditional geo-authentic habitats for ASR and the mainstream varieties of ASR on market, and basically consistent with the results of cluster analysis. This study suggests that the gray systematic theory based on the entropy weighting method can be used for the quality evaluation of ASR. The objective weighting of the entropy weight method improves the reliability of the gray correlation method and the scientificity of ASR quality evaluation.",

The results showed that nine monosaccharide derivatives have been well separated by HPLC under optimized conditions and the composition analysis of monosaccharides from APF samples could be achieved using acid hydrolysis and a set of monosaccharide standards. With this method, the within-day and day to day precisions of the composition determinations were 3.41-4.87% and 3.12-4.93% (RSD), respectively.

This study devised a metabolomics approach with GC-MS combined with pattern recognition to estimate the extent to which DBT alleviated CFS induced by food restriction and force swimming in rats. After 4 weeks of treatment, the endurance capability of rats was significantly better, and the motionless time was significantly shorter in the DBT group than in the CFS model group. Moreover, the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase increased, whereas the levels of malondialdehyde, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha decreased in the DBT treatment group. Fifteen significantly changed metabolites were observed in the serum of rats with CFS, which was reversed markedly by DBT treatment. Metabolic pathway analysis showed that DBT could possibly alleviate CFS in rats by regulating the biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan and the metabolism of glycine, serine, threonine, glycerolipid, glyoxylate, dicarboxylate, and tyrosine. It was observed that the metabolism of glycine, serine, and threonine was most closely related to the improvement in CFS by DBT treatment. This study showed that DBT could improve CFS effectively, and metabolomics was a powerful means to gain insights into the TCM formulas against CFS.",

Ten major bioactive components including two phenolic acids, two hydroxyl phthalides, four alkyl phthalides and two phthalide dimers were selected as evaluation chemical markers and the newly-established method was qualitatively and quantitatively validated. DG slices and whole roots dried in shade, sun light, hot air, vacuum, microwave, far infrared ray and combination of microwave and far infrared ray as well as the fresh DG samples were determined by the established methods. DG slices dried in hot air kept the similar chemical composition to that of fresh DG, while DG whole roots dried in vacuum retained highest contents of the major components. Coniferyl ferulate and ligustilide degraded significantly in DG slices dried by microwave, far infrared ray and their combination. The influence of such chemical changes induced by different drying methods on the bioactivities of DG warrants further investigation, so that the optimal drying method can be obtained for the standardization of DG herb.",

            "content": "Cyperi Rhizoma (Xiangfu) combined with either Angelicae Sinensis Radix (Danggui) or Chuanxiong Rhizoma (Chuanxiong) are herb pairs that are commonly used in clinical settings. To illustrate the herb-herb interactions that occur when extracts from these herbs are obtained together, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole electrospray tandem mass spectrometry and response surface analysis were used. Volatile components, α-cyperone, nootkatone, ligustilide, senkyunolide A and senkyunolide I, were accurately identified with high precision. When Xiangfu was combined with Danggui at a 1:1 ratio, or with Chuanxiong at a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio, the dissolution rates of α-cyperone and nootkatone from the herbs were greatly increased, compared to those obtained from Xiangfu extract alone. The dissolution rates of ligustilide, senkyunolide A and senkyunolide I from Danggui or Chuanxiong changed proportionally to changes in the ratios of Xiangfu with either Danggui or Chuanxiong. Response surface analysis results presented polynomial regression equations between the dissolution of tested compounds and the corresponding input variables, including compatibility proportions and solvent dosage. Based on the predicted results from response surface analysis, a combination of Xiangfu with Chuanxiong at a ratio of near 1:1, or with Danggui at 1:2, resulted in the maximum dissolution of five volatile components. Our established method could be applied to herb-herb interaction research, and the results may provide a scientific basis for the development of Cyperi Rhizoma-Chuanxiong Rhizoma, or Cyperi Rhizoma-Angelicae Sinensis Radix-based formulas and products.",

            "content": "We have shown that the natural compound z-butylidenephthalide (Bdph), isolated from the chloroform extract of Angelica sinensis, has antitumor effects. Because of the limitation of the blood-brain barrier, the Bdph dosage required for treatment of glioma is relatively high. To solve this problem, we developed a local-release system with Bdph incorporated into a biodegradable polyanhydride material, p(CPP-SA; Bdph-Wafer), and investigated its antitumor effects. On the basis of in vitro release kinetics, we demonstrated that the Bdph-Wafer released 50% of the available Bdph by the sixth day, and the release reached a plateau phase (90% of Bdph) by the 30th day. To investigate the in situ antitumor effects of the Bdph-Wafer on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), we used 2 xenograft animal models-F344 rats (for rat GBM) and nude mice (for human GBM)-which were injected with RG2 and DBTRG-05MG cells, respectively, for tumor formation and subsequently treated subcutaneously with Bdph-Wafers. We observed a significant inhibitory effect on tumor growth, with no significant adverse effects on the rodents. Moreover, we demonstrated that the antitumor effect of Bdph on RG2 cells was via the PKC pathway, which upregulated Nurr77 and promoted its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Finally, to study the effect of the interstitial administration of Bdph in cranial brain tumor, Bdph-Wafers were surgically placed in FGF-SV40 transgenic mice. Our Bdph-Wafer significantly reduced tumor size in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, our study showed that p(CPP-SA) containing Bdph delivered a sufficient concentration of Bdph to the tumor site and effectively inhibited the tumor growth in the glioma.",

Experimental fish (mean ± SE weight = 57 ± 1 g) were divided into two groups: a control group and a TCM (10 g/kg) group. After 4 weeks of the experimental trial, a significant increase in weight gain and specific growth rate and a lower feed conversion ratio were observed in fish fed a TCM-supplemented diet compared with control fish. Similarly, the immune response of Nile Tilapia in the TCM group showed enhanced lysozyme, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and immunoglobulin levels compared with the control fish. In comparison with the control, fish fed TCM showed significant up-regulation of β-defensin, lysozyme, heat shock protein 70, superoxide dismutase, and catalase genes in the intestine and head-kidney tissues. After a Streptococcus agalactiae challenge, survival of Nile Tilapia in the TCM group was 70% compared with 35% in the control.

In this study, a ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a triple quadrupole electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-TQ-MS/MS) method was developed for simultaneous quantification of three aromatic acids (chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid) and six phthalides (senkyunolide I, senkyunolide H, senkyunolide A, butylphthalide, ligustilide and butylidenephthalide) in DG, CX and FSS. The nine components were simultaneously determined within 10min. The proposed method was fully validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, precision, repeatability as well as recovery. The results showed that there were significant differences in their contents of DG and CX, and there were remarkable differences between the theorized content and observed content in FSS. The content of each component in formulae was not just the simple addition among its content in the single herbs.

In order to reveal the hematopoietic effect of this decoction, FSS was applied onto cultured K562 human leukemia cells and Hep3B human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Application of FSS in cultured K562 cells inhibited cell proliferation and subsequently induced the production of hemoglobin. Additionally, the mRNA expression of erythropoietin (EPO) was induced in a dose-dependent manner when FSS was applied to Hep3B cells.

The prepared N-dots have a small size (≤10 nm) and high percentage of nitrogen (39.9 %), which exceeds the content of carbon in the same N-dots. The N-dots exhibit characteristic blue fluorescence under UV light and up-conversion luminescence. The relatively intense CL emission is based on the direct oxidation of N-dots by DPA. The CL emission may be attributed to the high nitrogen content and the special structure of the N-dots. The CL mechanism of N-dots and DPA was investigated by using CL, UV-Vis absorption, IR, fluorescence, and radical scavenging experiments. This investigation provides a way to study the optical properties of N-dots. The analytical applicability of the N-dots and DPA CL system in the determination of ferulic acid (FA) was explored. The CL intensity was linearly proportional to the concentration of ferulic acid from 3.0 × 10-7 to 1.0 × 10-5 g mL-1 with a detection limit of 8.0 × 10-8 g mL-1 (3σ); the relative standard deviation was 2.4 % for 4.0 × 10-7 g mL-1 FA (n = 9).

The morphology and microstructure of the modified electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy analysis, and the electrochemical effective surface areas of the modified electrodes were also calculated by chronocoulometry method. Sensing properties of the electrochemical sensor were investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). It was found that ERGO was electrodeposited on the surface of GCE by using potentiostatic method. The proposed electrode exhibited electrocatalytic activity to the redox of FA because of excellent electrochemical properties of ERGO. The transfer electron number (n), electrode reaction rate constant (ks) and electron-transfer coefficient (α) were calculated as 1.12, 1.24s(-1), and 0.40, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, the oxidation peak current was proportional to FA concentration at 8.49 × 10(-8)mol L(-1) to 3.89 × 10(-5)mol L(-1) with detection limit of 2.06 × 10(-8)mol L(-1). This fabricated sensor also displayed acceptable reproducibility, long-term stability, and high selectivity with negligible interferences from common interfering species. The voltammetric sensor was successfully applied to detect FA in A. sinensis and biological samples with recovery values in the range of 99.91%-101.91%.",

            "content": "Ferulic acid, a phenolic acid derived mainly from a Chinese herb Angelica Sinensis Radix (ASR), was reported to reduce the formation of free radicals. Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT), a herbal decoction composing of Astragali Radix (AR) and ASR, has been utilized for more than 800 years in China having known anti-oxidative property. Ferulic acid is a major active ingredient in DBT; however, the role of ferulic acid within the herbal mixture has not been resolved. In order to elucidate the function of ferulic acid within this herbal decoction, a ferulic acid-depleted herbal decoction was created and named as DBTΔfa. The anti-oxidative properties of chemically modified DBT decoction were systemically compared in cultured H9C2 rat cardiomyoblast cell line. The application of DBT and DBTΔfa into the cultures showed functions in (i) decreasing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, detected by laser confocal; (ii) increasing of the activation of Akt; (iii) increasing the transcriptional activity of anti-oxidant response element (ARE); and (iv) increasing the expressions of anti-oxidant enzymes, i.e. NQO1 and GCLM. In all scenario, the aforementioned anti-oxidative properties of DBTΔfa in H9C2 cells were significantly reduced, as compared to authentic DBT. Thus, ferulic acid could be an indispensable chemical in DBT to orchestrate multi-components of DBT as to achieve maximal anti-oxidative functions.",

            "content": "Advanced melanoma can metastasize to distal organs from the skin and yield an aggressive disease and poor prognosis even after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. The compound n-Butylidenephthalide (BP) is isolated from Angelica sinensis, which is used to treat anemia and gynecological dysfunction in traditional Chinese medicine. Studies have indicated that BP can inhibit cancers, including brain, lung, prostate, liver, and colon cancers. However, because BP is a natural hydrophobic compound, it is quickly metabolized by the liver within 24 h, and thus has limited potential for development in cancer therapy. This study investigated the anticancer mechanisms of BP through encapsulation with a novel polycationic liposome containing polyethylenimine (PEI) and polyethylene glycol complex (LPPC) in melanoma cells. The results demonstrated that BP/LPPC had higher cytotoxicity than BP alone and induced cell cycle arrest at the G₀/G₁ phase in B16/F10 melanoma cells. The BP/LPPC-treated cell indicated an increase in subG₁ percentage and TUNEL positive apoptotic morphology through induction of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. The combination of BP and LPPC and clinical drug 5-Fluorouracil had a greater synergistic inhibition effect than did a single drug. Moreover, LPPC encapsulation improved the uptake of BP values through enhancement of cell endocytosis and maintained BP cytotoxicity activity within 24 h. In conclusion, BP/LPPC can inhibit growth of melanoma cells and induce cell arrest and apoptosis, indicating that BP/LPPC has great potential for development of melanoma therapy agents.",

            "content": "Two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC/TOF-MS) is superior for chromatographic separation and provides great sensitivity for complex biological fluid analysis in metabolomics. However, GC×GC/TOF-MS data processing is currently limited to vendor software and typically requires several preprocessing steps. In this work, we implement a web-based platform, which we call GC2MS, to facilitate the application of recent advances in GC×GC/TOF-MS, especially for metabolomics studies. The core processing workflow of GC2MS consists of blob/peak detection, baseline correction, and blob alignment. GC2MS treats GC×GC/TOF-MS data as pictures and clusters the pixels as blobs according to the brightness of each pixel to generate a blob table. GC2MS then aligns the blobs of two GC×GC/TOF-MS data sets according to their distance and similarity. The blob distance and similarity are the Euclidean distance of the first and second retention times of two blobs and the Pearson's correlation coefficient of the two mass spectra, respectively. GC2MS also directly corrects the raw data baseline. The analytical performance of GC2MS was evaluated using GC×GC/TOF-MS data sets of Angelica sinensis compounds acquired under different experimental conditions and of human plasma samples. The results show that GC2MS is an easy-to-use tool for detecting peaks and correcting baselines, and GC2MS is able to align GC×GC/TOF-MS data sets acquired under different experimental conditions.

Hedysari Radix (HR), a herb having similar chemical composition with AR, has been commonly used as a substitute of AR in herbal decoction. In order to evaluate the possible replacement of HR for AR in Chinese herbal decoction, systematic comparison of AR and HR was done by chemical and biological assessments. The water extract of AR contained higher levels of calycosin, calycosin-glucoside, ononin, astragaloside III and astragaloside IV, while higher amount of formononetin was found in the HR extract. The estrogenic, erythropoetic and osteogenic effects were compared between the water extracts of AR and HR, and in all cases AR extract showed higher biological activities. Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT) is a very common herbal decoction for woman aliment, and which contains AR and Angelica Sinensis Radix. Here, we generated two forms of DBT having either AR or HR as the major herbs. Chemically, AR-contained DBT showed higher amounts of various active chemicals, except formononetin that was higher in HR-contained DBT. In parallel, the estrogenic, osteogenic and erythropoetic effects of DBT containing AR showed better activities than that of DBT having HR. Thus, AR and HR showed distinct differences in terms of chemical and biological properties. In order to achieve the best therapeutical effect, as well as to guarantee the safety, AR is recommended here to be used for making DBT.",

Two hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, HepG2 and J5, were treated with either N-butylidenephthalide or a vehicle, and cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated. Apoptosis-related mRNA and proteins expressed, including orphan receptor family Nurr1, NOR-1, and Nur77, were evaluated as well as the effect of N-butylidenephthalide in an in vivo xenograft model. N-butylidenephthalide caused growth inhibition of both the cell lines at 25 microg/ml. Furthermore, N-butylidenephthalide-induced apoptosis seems to be related to Nur77 translocation from nucleus to cytosol, which leads to cytochrome c release and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. N-butylidenephthalide-related tumor apoptosis was associated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (AKT)/glycogen synthase kinase-3beta rather than the mitogen-activated protein kinase or protein kinase C pathway. Blockade of AKT activation enhanced proliferation inhibition and the induction of phosphor-Bcl-2 and Nur77 proteins. Besides, the increasing apoptosis by BP via transfection wild-type cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) into tumor cell was suppressed by dominant phosphorylation site mutation of CREB. This finding suggested CREB pathway was also partly involved in tumor apoptosis caused by BP. Administration of N-butylidenephthalide showed similar antitumoral effects in both HepG2 and J5 xenograft tumors. N-Butylidenephthalide induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a potential clinical use of this compound for improving the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",

In this work, for the first time, headspace single-drop microextraction (HS-SDME) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was developed for the determination of Z-ligustilide in rabbit plasma after oral administration of essential oil of danggui. The extraction parameters of solvent selection, solvent volume, sample temperature, extraction time, stirring rate, and ion strength were systemically optimized. Furthermore, the method linearity, detection limit, and precision were also investigated. It was shown that the proposed method provided good linearity (0.02-20 microg/mL, R2 = 0.997), low detection limit (10 ng/mL), and good precision (RSD value less than 9%). Finally, HS-SDME followed by GC/MS was used for fast determination of Z-ligustilide in rabbit plasma at different time intervals after oral administration of danggui essential oil. The experimental results suggest that HS-SDME followed by GC/MS is a simple, sensitive, and low-cost method for the determination of Z-ligustilide in plasma, and a low-cost approach to pharmacokinetics studies of active components in TCMs.",

Therefore, we would like to probe the neuroprotective functions of this ancient herbal formula in vitro.,Method:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The neuroprotective effects of DBT in the Aβ-induced cell death were detected in cultured cortical neurons by multiple techniques, i.e. confocal and western blot.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      In the cultures, application of DBT reduced Aβ-induced apoptosis rate in a dose-dependent manner. In Aβ-treated cortical neurons, the expression ratio of Bcl2 to Bax was altered by DBT. In parallel, application of DBT markedly suppressed the Aβ-induced expressions of apoptotic markers, i.e. cleaved-caspase 3/9 and PARP.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Taken these results, DBT shows promising protective effects against Aβ-induced stress or insult in cultured neurons.",

However, few detailed pharmacokinetic studies about TA or its main component in human have been done to date. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of astragaloside IV (AGS-IV), the primary ingredient of TA, and tolerance of TA after single- and multi-intravenous infusion of astragalosides injection (AI) in healthy Chinese volunteers. A LC-MS/MS assay was developed for AGS-IV determination in human plasma and urine, and the PK parameters were estimated using non-compartmental methods. The mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) values of AGS-IV were 2.12, 3.59, 3.71 and 5.17 μg ml(-1) after single doses of 200, 300, 400 and 500 ml of AI, respectively. The corresponding mean values of area under the plasma concentration (AUC(0-∞)) were 4.38, 9.75, 13.59 and 18.22 μg h ml(-1), respectively, and the mean values of elimination half-life (t1/2) were 2.14, 2.59, 2.62 and 2.69 h, respectively. In the repeated dose study, no significant difference was observed between the PK parameters, peak time (Tmax), t1/2 and AUC, of day 1 and day 7. Cumulative urinary excretion of AGS-IV was 3.91% within 24 h after administration of 500 ml AI. AI was safe and well tolerated, and the adverse events, such as raised total bilirubin and rash, were mild and resolved spontaneously. In summary, the pharmacokinetic properties of AGS-IV are based on linear pharmacokinetics over the doses ranging from 200 to 500 ml of AI. No accumulation of AGS-IV was observed after repeated administration of AI once daily. AI was safe and well tolerated in this study, although cases of transient adverse events were observed.",

DBT was incorporated into porous composites (GGT) made from genipin-crosslinked gelatin and β-triclacium phosphates as bone substitutes (GGTDBT). The biological response of mouse calvarial bone to these composites was evaluated by in vivo imaging systems (IVIS), micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), and histology analysis. IVIS images revealed a stronger fluorescent signal in GGTDBT-treated defect than in GGT-treated defect at 8 weeks after implantation. Micro-CT analysis demonstrated that the level of repair from week 4 to 8 increased from 42.1% to 71.2% at the sites treated with GGTDBT, while that increased from 33.2% to 54.1% at GGT-treated sites. These findings suggest that the GGTDBT stimulates the innate regenerative capacity of bone, supporting their use in bone tissue regeneration.",

Furthermore, the metabolites were reversed by DBT treatment, offering evidence for the antifatigue effect. In addition, intervention of DBT changed the levels of biochemical parameters. DBT showed obvious efficacy on the fatigued mice possibly by regulating the pathways of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan metabolism, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, and TCA cycle.

Usually, DBT is composed of one portion of Radix Angelicae Sinensis (RAS) and five portions of Radix Astragali (RA). Clinically, Radix Hedysari (RH) is sometimes used by TCM physicians to replace RA in DBT. In order to verity whether the chemical constituents of the DBT1 (RA:RAS = 5:1, w/w) and DBT2 (RH:RAS = 5:1, w/w) share similarities the chemical profiles of the two DBTs crude extracts and urine samples were analyzed and compared with the aid of HPLC-DAD-ESI-IT-TOF-MSn, which determines the total ion chromatogram (TIC) and multi-stage mass spectra (MSn). Then, the DBT1 and DBT2 were identified and compared on the basis of the TIC and the MSn. In the first experiment (with crude extracts), 69 compounds (C1-C69) were identified from the DBT1; 46 compounds (c1-c46) were identified from the DBT2. In the second experiment(with urine samples), 44 compounds (M1-M44) were identified from the urine samples of rats that had been administered DBT1, and 34 compounds (m1-m34) were identified from the urine samples of rats that had been administered DBT2. Identification and comparison of the chemical compositions were carried out between the DBT1 and DBT2 of the crude extracts and urine samples respectively. Our results showed that the two crude extracts of the DBTs have quite different chemical profiles. The reasons for their differences were that the special astragalosides in DBT1 and the isoflavonoid glycosides formed the malonic acid esters undergo single esterification and acetyl esters undergo acetylation in DBT1. In contrast, the urine from DBT1-treated rats strongly resembled that of DBT2-treated rats. These metabolites originate mainly from formononetin, calycosin and their related glycosides, and they were formed mainly by the metabolic process of reduction, deglycosylation, demethylation, hydrogenation and sulfation. The HPLC-DAD-ESI-IT-TOF-MSn method was successfully applied for the rapid chemical profiles evaluation of two DBTs and their related urine samples.",

These promising identified biomarkers underpin the metabolic pathway including phenylalanine metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism and arginine and proline metabolism are disturbed in the acute blood stasis rats, which identified by using pathway analysis with MetPA. The altered metabolites and hemorheological indexes could be regulated closer to normal level after DG, HH and GH intervention. In term of activate blood circulation function, GH was the most effective as shown by the relative distance in PLS-DA score plots and relative intensity of metabolomics trategy, reflecting the synergic action between Danggui and Honghua.

The more potent cardioprotection afforded by DBT pretreatment than that of a mixture of Astragali and Angelica root extracts was associated with a much higher extraction yield of active ingredients from Angelica root in the herbal decoction. The high level of active ingredients might increase their bioavailability after oral administration. DBT pretreatment could enhance myocardial mitochondrial as well as red blood cell (RBC) glutathione status, thereby increasing their resistance to oxidative stress-induced injury in rats. The measurement of RBC glutathione status may serve as a useful index for the antioxidant effect produced by DBT treatment in human subjects.",

Normal control rats (n = 7) received saline rather than puromycin, and an untreated control group (n = 7) received puromycin but no treatment. After 12 weeks, stained sections of the glomerulus and tubulointerstitium were evaluated for injury. Immunohistochemistry staining measured extracellular matrix components, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1), osteopontin, ED-1-positive cells, and alpha-actin. TGFbeta1 mRNA was assessed by in situ hybridization. Renin, ACE activity, angiotensin, and aldosterone were measured by radioimmunoassay or colorimetry. In the untreated rats, chronic renal injury progressed to marked fibrosis at 12 weeks. Astragalus and Angelica significantly reduced deterioration of renal function and histologic damage. Expressions of type III and IV collagen, fibronectin, and laminin also decreased significantly. This anti-fibrotic effect was similar to that of enalapril. The herbs had no effect on the renin-angiotensin system but did reduce the number of ED-1-positive, and alpha-actin positive cells and expression of osteopontin compared to untreated controls. The combination of Astragalus and Angelica retarded the progression of renal fibrosis and deterioration of renal function with comparable effects of enalapril. These effects were not caused by blocking the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system, but associated with suppression of the overexpression of TGFbeta1 and osteopontin, reduction of infiltrating macrophages, and less activation of renal intrinsic cells [corrected].",

According to the old tradition, RAS had to be processed with yellow wine before DBT preparation, which markedly reduced the amount of ligustilide in RAS and DBT, as well as enhanced the bioactivities of DBT. Here, we hypothesized that ligustilide would be an ingredient that possessed suppressive effects on DBT's functions. In the presence of ligustilide, the amount of astragaloside IV, calycosin, formononetin, and total polysaccharides extracted from RA were decreased. An increase of ligustilide caused a decrease of DBT's osteogenic activity in stimulating proliferation and differentiation of cultured bone cells. In addition, in the presence of a high level of ligustilide, DBT caused a side effect inducing the proliferation of breast MCF-7 cells. The current results strongly suggest that ligustilide is a negative regulator that hinders DBT to achieve its biological efficacy, which supports the traditional practice of preparing DBT using the ethanol-treated RAS.",

            "content": "The dried root of Angelica sinensis (A. sinensis) has been widely used in Chinese traditional medicine for various diseases such as inflammation, osteoarthritis, infections, mild anemia, fatigue, and high blood pressure. Searching for the secondary metabolites of A. sinensis has been mainly conducted. However, the bioactivity of coumarins in the plant remains unexplored. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of glabralactone, a coumarin compound from A. sinensis, using in vitro and in vivo models, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of action. Glabralactone effectively inhibited nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells. The downregulation of LPS-induced mRNA and protein expression of iNOS, TNF-α, IL-1β, and miR-155 was found by glabralactone. The activation of NF-κB and TRIF-dependent IRF-3 pathway was also effectively suppressed by glabralactone in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Glabralactone (5 and 10 mg/kg) exhibited an in vivo anti-inflammatory activity with the reduction of paw edema volume in carrageenan-induced rat model, and the expressions of iNOS and IL-1β proteins were suppressed by glabralactone in the paw soft tissues of the animal model. Taken together, glabralactone exhibited an anti-inflammatory activity in in vitro and in vivo models. These findings reveal that glabralactone might be one of the potential components for the anti-inflammatory activity of A. sinensis and may be prioritized in the development of a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",

Their phenolic contents (including total phenolic, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, same as below) were then determined by HPLC or spectrophotometry. The sequence of phenolic contents was roughly identical with that of antioxidant activity. When the values of 1/IC(50) of various antioxidant assays were used to evaluate the level of antioxidant of the RAS extracts, (plot between 1/IC(50) values and phenolic contents), the correlation coefficient (R) ranged from 0.642 to 0.941, with an average value of 0.839.

Node.js was used to store the database by running JavaScript. Vue.js is a front-end framework used for web interface development. A total of 135 sets of information related to the interactions of ginseng, ginkgo and dong quai with Western medicine from the literature identified in Medline were collected, followed by critical reviews to prepare nineteen items of information for each HDI monograph. A total of 80 sets of validated HDIs met all criteria and were further assessed at the individual reliability level (likely, possible, and unevaluable) and labeled with the \"interaction\" item. This query system of the website can be operated in both the Chinese and English languages to obtain all monographs on HDIs in the database, including bilingual interaction data. The database of HDI monographs can be updated by simply uploading a new version of the information Excel file. The designed \"smart search\" module, in addition to the \"single search\", is convenient for requesting multiple searches. Among the \"likely\" interactions (n = 26), 50% show negative HDIs.

Several bioactive nonstarch polysaccharides (NSPs) were reported to alleviate RA, but the key colonic genes accountable for this alleviation were elusive. Using collagen-induced arthritis as an RA model, colonic candidate genes related to RA were selected by transcriptome and methylome. The key genes were determined by comparing the transcriptome, methylome, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction profiles in RA rats with and without Lycium barbarum polysaccharides' treatment and further validated using Angelica sinensis polysaccharides and Astragalus propinquus polysaccharides for comparison. Both colonic genes γ-glutamyltransferase 7 (Ggt7) and angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (Ace) were downregulated by RA, and they were upregulated after L. barbarum polysaccharides' and A. sinensis polysaccharides' intervention that reduced the RA-caused hypermethylation status in nucleotide sites in the exon/promoter region of the two genes. However, the A. propinquus polysaccharides' intervention barely reduced the hypermethylation in the corresponding sites, failing to recover the expressions of these two genes and improve RA. Therefore, the colonic Ggt7 and Ace can be considered as key genes accountable for RA alleviation by bioactive NSP intervention. This study provides a more comprehensive insight into diet intervention to improve RA.",

Of these, senkyunolide I, senkyunolide H, Z-6,7-epoxyligustilide, 3-butylidene-7-hydroxyphthalide, Z-ligustilide, Z-butylidenephthalide, Diels-Alder dimers of ligustilide, linolenic acid, linoleic acid and falcarindiol were tentatively identified from their MS, UV spectra and retention behavior by comparing the results with the published literature. At least ten components were found in rabbit plasma but not in DOS, indicating that these components must be metabolites of some of the components in the original extract. The results prove that the proposed method can be used to rapidly analyze multiple constituents in TCMs, and to screen for bioactive compounds by comparing and contrasting the chromatographic fingerprints of DOS and plasma samples.",

Previously, we found, for the first time, that an acidic glycan from Angelica Sinensis Polysaccharides (APSs), namely the APS-3c, could protect rat cartilage from OA due to promoting glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis in chondrocytes. In the present work, we tried to further the understanding of ASP-3c's anti-OA activity.,Methodology/principal findings:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Human primary chondrocytes were treated with APS-3c or/and recombinant human interleukin 1β (IL-1β).

Then, we induced a rat OA model with papain, and found that APS-3c also stimulated GAG synthesis and gene expression of USSs, IGF1 and IGF1R in vivo. Additionally, recombinant human IGF1 and IGF1R inhibitor NP-AEW541 were applied to figure out the correlation between stimulated gene expression of USSs, IGF1 and IGF1R induced by APS-3c.

High-grade pathological changes were significantly increased. Decreased DNA damage and P53 level reflected the disrupted reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration in colorectal tissue, which led to an imbalance of proliferative and apoptotic relationships.

However, in the clinic, the combination ratio of Astragalus and Angelica to treat low hematopoietic function is not an absolute 5 : 1 ratio, suggesting that the herbs may promote hematopoiesis better after being combined at a certain range of ratios. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of different ratio combinations of Astragalus and Angelica on bone marrow hematopoiesis suppression induced by cyclophosphamide (CTX) and to probe the interaction and mechanism of Astragalus combined with Angelica in promoting hematopoiesis.

The potential mechanisms of the combinations of Astragalus and Angelica that promote hematopoiesis include the dissolution of the effective components, promoting the synthesis and secretion of hematopoietic growth factor (HGF) and the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs).",

In order to investigate the effects and mechanism of Angelica sinensis(AS) on Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg in mice with asthma and Yin deficiency syndrome, asthmatic and Yin deficiency syndrome Balb/c mice models were established by injecting and inhaling ovalbumin(OVA) and thyroxin. The models were treated with dexamethasone(DXM), AS extract and AS extract+DXM, respectively. Pathological examination of lung tissues was conducted by HE staining, and ELISA was used to detect the levels of IL-4, IL-17, IFN-γ, TGF-β as well as retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (RORγt). Results showed that AS could significantly improve the situation of inflammation infiltration, increase ratios of IFN-γ/IL-4 and TGF-β/IL-17, decrease the levels of RORγt in lung tissues. The AS+DXM group showed a best treatment effect. The results indicated that AS played a therapeutic role for asthma with Yin deficiency syndrome and improved airway inflammation by inhibiting the expression of RORγt in lung tissues and regulating the balance of Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg.",

Volatile oil of charred AS (C-VOAS), wine-processed AS (J-VOAS), locally processed AS (T-VOAS) and oil-process AS (Y-VOAS) were applied to intervene the rat acute paw swelling inflammation model induced by Carrageenan. Changes in serum HIS, 5-HT, PGE2 and TNF-α content in rats were detected. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to detect the metabolites in plasma. Potential biomarkers were investigated according to principal component analysis method and partial least-squares discriminant analysis. According to the results, C-VOAS and J-VOAS could significantly inhibit inflammatory mediators Histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, prostaglandin-E2 and cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P<0.01), and T-VOAS and Y-VOAS also showed a significantly inhibitory effect (P<0.05). Compared with the normal group, 14 endogenous metabolite biomarkers showed metabolic disturbance in plasma (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Compared with acute inflammation model group, C-VOAS and J-VOAS could better recover the levels of the endogenous metabolites (P<0.05 or P<0.01) than T-VOAS and Y-VOAS (P<0.05 or P<0.01). This study suggests that C-VOAS and J-VOAS show a better anti-inflammatory effect than T-VOAS and Y-VOAS. Therefore, the metabolomic method could be used to expound the anti-inflammatory mechanism of volatile oils from different processed products of AS, and provide a theoretical basis for clinical application of VOAS.",

Both AR-ASR combinations and simvastatin were dissolved in saline solution and given daily by gavage. The left ventricle function, infarct size, heart tissue injury, apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, leukocyte infiltrates, capillary density and expression of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, Bcl-2, Bax, Bad, IL-1β, IL-6, VEGF, p-Akt and p-eNOS were analysed.Results: Different combinations of AR and ASR improve cardiac function and reduce infarct size (61.15% vs. 39.3%, 42.65% and 45.5%) and tissue injury through different mechanisms. When AR was combined with ASR at ratio of 1:1, the inflammation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were suppressed (p < 0.05, p < 0.01).

Danggui from Minxian County, Gansu Province is the best in quality. To rapidly and nondestructively discriminate Danggui from the authentic region of origin from that from an unauthentic region, an electronic nose coupled with multivariate statistical analyses was developed. Two different feature extraction methods were used to ensure the authentic region and unauthentic region of Danggui origin could be discriminated. One feature extraction method is to capture the average value of the maximum response of the electronic nose sensors (feature extraction method 1). The other one is to combine the maximum response of the sensors with their inter-ratios (feature extraction method 2). Multivariate statistical analyses, including principal component analysis (PCA), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) were employed. Nineteen samples were analyzed by PCA, SIMCA and HCA. Then the remaining samples (GZM1, SH) were projected onto the SIMCA model to validate the models. The results indicated that, in the use of feature extraction method 2, Danggui from Yunnan Province and Danggui from Gansu Province could be successfully discriminated using the electronic nose coupled with PCA, SIMCA and HCA, which suggested that the electronic-nose system could be used as a simple and rapid technique for the discrimination of Danggui between authentic and unauthentic region of origin.",

In the present study, we investigated the effects and possible mechanisms of A&A on vasoactivators in the process of renal interstitial fibrosis.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into sham, unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and UAA (UUO plus A&A administration) groups. After oral administration of A&A (14 g/kg/d) for 3, 7 and 10 days, morphological changes were evaluated by HE, Masson and Sirius red staining technique. The levels of Ang-II, ET-1, and the activities of different nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) in renal homogenate were measured by radioimmunoassay. The nitrite concentration as nitric oxide (NO) production was measured using the Griess reagent. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining were performed to determine the expressions of eNOS, nNOS, and iNOS in the kidney. The ability of scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated by spectrophotometry.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Morphological analysis showed severe interstitial mononuclear cells infiltration, tubular atrophy, renal fibrosis and collagen expression in kidneys of UUO group, which reduced by A&A administration (p<0.05, UAA vs. UUO group). The levels of Ang-II and ET-I were increased in obstructed kidneys, but not significantly changed after A&A administration. NO production did not change in obstructed kidney at day 3 but increased in day 7 and day 10. Administering A&A progressively increased NO production by 2.2, 1.2, and 1.2 fold at days 3, 7 and 10, respectively. The activities of constitutive NOS and iNOS were comparable between UUO group and sham group. In contrast, the activity of constitutive NOS was much higher in UAA than that of UUO rats, which increased 78%, 68% and 78% at days 3, 7 and 10 respectively, although the protein expression of eNOS, nNOS and iNOS in renal tissue had no change in UAA rats. The activities of scavenging ROS in UUO group were not significantly different from the sham group at days 3 and 7, but increased at day 10 (24.1+/-15.0 vs. 10.1+/-0.8 U/min/mg protein, p<0.05). After A&A administration, the activities of scavenging ROS were significantly increased at days 3 and 7 (51.5+/-17.9 vs. 11.7+/-7.4 U/min/mg protein, p<0.05; and 16.1+/-5.6 vs. 7.7+/-1.4 U/min/mg protein, p<0.05) respectively, comparing with the UUO group.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The anti-fibrosis effects of A&A might be associated with enhancing NO production via eNOS activation and scavenging ROS, and in turn might improve ischemic microvasculature and attenuate interstitial fibrosis.",

            "content": "Thermogenesis (non-exercise activity) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) promotes energy expenditure because of its higher number of mitochondria than white adipose tissue (WAT). The main function of thermogenesis in BAT can counteract obesity through the dissipation of calories as heat. N-butylidenephthalide (BP) is a natural derivative from Angelica sinensis, a Chinese herb that has been used for thousands of years. In this report, we demonstrated that BP improved the metabolic profiles of mice with high fat diet-induced obesity (DIO) by preventing weight gain, improving serum blood parameters, enhancing energy expenditure, stimulating white fat browning, and reversing hepatic steatosis. Further investigations demonstrated that BP administration upregulated the mRNA expression of beige (CD137, TMEM26) and brown fat selected genes (UCP1, PRDM16, PGC-1α, PPARγ) in white adipose tissues. In vitro studies, BP treatment increased multilocular lipid droplet levels, induced β-adrenergic receptor (cAMP/PKA) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling (AMPK/acetyl-CoA carboxylase/SIRT1), and increased oxygen consumption in murine differentiated beige adipocytes, and the effects of BP were blocked by an AMPK inhibitor. BP promoted the interaction of AMPK with PGC-1α in beige adipocytes. Our findings provide novel insights into the application of BP in regulating energy metabolism and suggest its utility for clinical use in the treatment of obesity and related diseases.",

            "content": "Extraction of Angelica sinensis polysaccharides (ASP) was optimized by the utilization of response surface methodology, RSM. Through the analysis, extraction time and water/solid were found to be the most significant factors. Based on contour plots and variance analysis, optimum operational conditions for maximizing polysaccharides yield (5.6%) were found to be extraction time 130 min, water/solid 5, and extraction number 5. A. sinensis polysaccharides (150 and 300 mg/kg) were administered for 15 days. The hepatoprotective activity was assessed using various biochemical parameters. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransfere (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were significantly restored toward normalization by the extracts (150 and 300 mg/kg body weight). ASP (150 and 300 mg/kg body weight) significantly increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes. It can be concluded that ASP possesses significant protective effect against hepatotoxicity induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). This protective effect appears due to ASP antioxidant properties.",

In this paper, four hydrosoluble fractions were obtained and purified from A. sinensis including: Angelica polysaccharide, oligosaccharides (Angelica oligosaccharide and Angelica sucrose) and Angelica total amino acid, named APS, AOS, AS, and TAA, respectively. Moreover, the immunomodulatory activity of these four fractions on murine peritoneal macrophages were assessed and compared from various aspects including cell proliferation, phagocytic activity, nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) release, induced nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) and lysozyme (LZM) activity, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression on cell surface and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene expression. Although APS exhibited the most obvious growth facilitative activity, AOS did better in activation of H(2)O(2) release; TAA exerted the best activation of phagocytic activity, production of NO and ICAM-1 expression. Furthermore, we found that the action mode of the four fractions was similar to that of LPS and the mechanism may be related to the upregulation of TLR4 mRNA. These results demonstrated that oligosaccharide and amino acid fractions, as well as polysaccharide fraction of Radix A. sinensis, could serve as immunomodulator and TLR4 as one of the immune receptors may play important role for this action.",

Angelica sinensis and Zingiber officinale Roscoe are two common dietetic Chinese herbs, which are traditionally used for complementary treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. As bioactive constituents, volatile and pungent substances of these two herbs could be effectively extracted together by supercritical fluid extraction. In this study, the supercritical fluid extract of Angelica sinensis and Zingiber officinale Roscoe (AZ-SFE) was obtained by an optimized extraction process and it was chemically characterized. The anti-inflammatory effect and underlying mechanism of AZ-SFE were evaluated in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cell model and a 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis rat model. AZ-SFE notably inhibited the production of NO in LPS-stimulated macrophages, and it inhibited the proliferation of Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced splenocytes with suppression of the Th1 immune response. In vivo, the study demonstrated that AZ-SFE significantly alleviated disease activity, colonic shortening, macroscopic damage and histological injury of TNBS-treated rats with reduction of oxidative stress, suppression of inflammatory cytokines, and modulation of hepcidin and serum iron. These findings suggested that AZ-SFE may be a promising supplement for current IBD therapy.",

THSWD has great demand in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), gynecology, orthopedics, and internal medicine. According to classical records, three medicinal materials, namely Rehmanniae radix, Angelica sinensis, and Carthamus tinctorius, used in THSWD need to be \"washed with yellow rice wine.\" In the study of TCM prescriptions, the processing methods of medicinal materials not only needed to follow traditional records but also should consider modern technical conditions. Many medicinal materials in the repertoire of classical prescriptions involve yellow rice wine processing. Determining the processing method for medicinal materials is a key and difficult problem in the research and development of classical prescriptions.,Aim of the study:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      With THSWD as the representative, this study analyzed differences between no processing method, the modern processing method of \"stir-frying the materials with yellow rice wine,\" and the traditional processing method of \"washing with yellow rice wine.\" We focused on three aspects: composition, efficacy, and endogenous metabolism. This study aimed to provide a reference for research on the processing methods of medicinal materials used in classical prescriptions.,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      UPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS was used to quickly identify and classify the main chemical compounds of THSWD. A model of primary dysmenorrhea (PD) was established using estradiol benzoate combined with oxytocin. The latent period and writhing time; the levels of serum PGF2α, PGE2, ET-1, and β-EP; and the pathological sections of the uterus were observed to determine their pharmacodynamic differences. GC-TOF/MS was used to analyze the differences in serum metabolites in rats.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      A total of 54 active compounds were identified, and the results showed that catalpol and rehmapicroside disappeared following yellow rice wine processing. Compared with materials processed by the traditional method, the relative contents of 15 components, such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and digitalis C, increased in materials processed by the modern method. However, the relative contents of 16 components, such as hydroxysafflor yellow A, verbascoside, and ferulic acid, decreased in the modern processing method. The modern and classic processing methods acted on PD through different metabolic pathways. THSWD obtained by classical processing methods mainly treated PD through anti-inflammatory and estrogen metabolism pathways, whereas THSWD obtained by modern processing methods mainly treated PD through anti-inflammatory metabolic pathways.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The study revealed the differences in different yellow rice wine processing methods in terms of chemical composition of the THSWD obtained, as well as the mechanisms of action for the treatment of PD.

Moreover, the optimal concentration of DBT for bone cell culture was also determined by colorimetric, ALP activity, nodule formation, Western blotting, wound-healing, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity assays. Consequently, the most appropriate weight ratio of RA to RAS for the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts was 5:1. Moreover, the most effective concentration of DBT was 1,000 μg/mL, which significantly increased the number of osteoblasts, intracellular ALP levels, and nodule numbers, while inhibiting osteoclast activity. Additionally, 1,000 μg/mL of DBT was able to stimulate p-ERK and p-JNK signal pathway.

            "content": "Cancer development has been linked to epigenetic modifications of cancer oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes; in advanced metastatic cancers, severe epigenetic modifications are present. We previously demonstrated that the progression of prostate tumors in TRAMP mice is associated with methylation silencing of the Nrf2 promoter and a reduced level of transcription of Nrf2 and Nrf2 target genes. Radix Angelicae Sinensis (RAS; Danggui) is a medicinal herb and health food supplement that has been widely used in Asia for centuries. Z-Ligustilide (Lig) is one of the bioactive components of RAS. We investigated the potential of Lig and RAS to restore Nrf2 gene expression through epigenetic modification in TRAMP C1 cells. Lig and RAS induced the mRNA and protein expression of endogenous Nrf2 and Nrf2 downstream target genes, such as HO-1, NQO1, and UGT1A1. Bisulfite genomic sequencing revealed that Lig and RAS treatment decreased the level of methylation of the first five CpGs of the Nrf2 promoter. A methylation DNA immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that Lig and RAS significantly decreased the relative amount of methylated DNA in the Nrf2 gene promoter region. Lig and RAS also inhibited DNA methyltransferase activity in vitro. Collectively, these results suggest that Lig and RAS are able to demethylate the Nrf2 promoter CpGs, resulting in the re-expression of Nrf2 and Nrf2 target genes. Epigenetic modifications of genes, including Nrf2, may therefore contribute to the overall health benefits of RAS, including the anticancer effect of RAS and its bioactive component, Lig.",

Eighteen patients showed no improvement using the conventional non-operative management (frequent curettage of abscess cavity), after which administration of GTTC was commenced. The other four patients received GTTC from the beginning of their treatment. A dose of 0.1-0.2 g/kg of GTTC was given orally twice a day. The period between onset of peri-anal abscess and the commencement of GTTC (pre-GTTC period) was compared to the period until remission after administration of GTTC (post-GTTC period). The relationship between the GTTC dose, age at onset of peri-anal abscess, post-GTTC period, and relapse rates were investigated.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Twenty-one patients reached remission, but a 4-year-old boy failed to reach remission and he required fistelectomy. Pre-GTTC periods were from 11 days to 3 years (median 50 days) and statistically longer than post-GTTC periods (4-65 days, median 7 days). There was a reverse correlation between the age at onset of peri-anal abscess and post-GTTC period (r = -044, P < 0.05). There was no statistical correlation between the dose of GTTC and post-GTTC period. Five patients showed relapse after discontinuing GTTC, all of them could be resolved with augmentation of the dose. The onset of peri-anal abscess in patients who relapsed were all < 3 months of age.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Ginseng and Tang-kuei Ten Combination seemed to accelerate the recovery of patients with fistula-in-ano in infancy.",

            "content": "A novel polysaccharide isolated from Angelica sinensis, named APS-1d showed cytotoxic activity towards several cancer cell lines in vitro. However, the precise antitumor mechanisms of this compound are unknown. In this study, we investigated the pro-apoptotic effects of APS-1d in human cervical cancer HeLa cells both in vitro and in vivo, and further elucidated the mechanisms of this action. Inhibition of HeLa cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay and the therapeutic efficacy of APS-1d was evaluated by human cancer xenografts in nude mice. Cell apoptosis was examined with flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. The mechanism of action of APS-1d was investigated by Western blot analysis. APS-1d decreased HeLa cell proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in vitro. In addition, APS-1d significantly inhibited tumor growth in athymic nude mice. Characteristic manifestations of apoptosis including apoptotic morphological features and the sub- G(0)/G(1) peaks were observed when the cells were treated with APS-1d. Further analysis showed that APS-1d-induced apoptosis was associated with the regulation of Bcl-2 family protein expression, a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential, and an increase in the cytosolic cytochrome c levels. Sequentially, APS-1d increased the activities of caspase-9, -3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in a concentration-dependent manner, however, no obvious activation of Bid and caspase-8 was observed. Pretreatment with Z-LEHD-FMK, a specific inhibitor of caspase-9, significantly attenuated APS-1d-induced cell apoptosis, and activation of caspase-3. Taken together, our studies indicate that APS-1d is capable of inhibiting HeLa cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in these cells which primarily involves the activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.",

This study aimed to investigate the effect and possible underlying mechanisms of Radix Angelica Sinensis and Radix Hedysari ultrafiltration extract (RAS-RH) on X-irradiation-induced cardiac fibrosis in rats. Our data demonstrated that (a) a single dose of total body irradiation (TBI) at 8 Gy resulted in cardiac fibrosis, whereas the control hearts exhibited less collagen and fibrosis. RAS-RH mitigated these morphological injuries. (b) TBI resulted in an increase in the serum levels of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and troponin-I (TnI). RAS-RH inhibited the release of TBI-induced serum TGF-β1 and the TnI levels. (c) TBI inhibited the apoptosis of primary rat cardiac fibroblasts, whereas RAS-RH induced the apoptosis of primary rat cardiac fibroblasts after X- irradiation. (d) TBI resulted in an increase in the expression of osteopontin (OPN), c-fos, c-jun, miRNA-21 and collagen1α (COL1α) in primary rat cardiac fibroblasts, and RAS-RH mitigated the TBI-induced increased expression of OPN, c-jun, miRNA-21 and COL1α. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that RAS-RH exerts antifibrotic effects possibly through inducing the apoptosis of fibroblasts, inhibiting the release of serum TGF-β1, reducing the levels of serum TnI and reducing the expression of OPN, c-jun, miRNA-21 and COL1α. Therefore, RAS-RH may potentially be developed as a medical countermeasure for the mitigation of radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis.",

            "content": "Ligustilide (LIG) is a major component of Radix Angelica Sinensis, and reportedly has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Recent studies have demonstrated that spinal astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic pain. Here we investigated the anti-nociceptive effect of systemic treatment with LIG on chronic inflammatory pain and explored possible mechanisms. Unilateral hindpaw injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) induced persistent pain hypersensitivity. Repeated daily intravenous treatment with LIG, either before or after CFA injection, attenuated CFA-induced thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. The same treatment also inhibited CFA-induced keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA and protein increases in astrocytes of the spinal cord. In vitro study showed LIG dose-dependently reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced upregulation of KC and MCP-1 mRNA in astrocyte cultures. Interestingly, LIG treatment did not affect CFA- or LPS-induced glial fibrillary acidic protein upregulation, but did inhibit CFA-induced phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB (p-NFκB) upregulation in spinal astrocytes. Furthermore, intrathecal injection of NFκB inhibitor attenuated CFA-induced pain hypersensitivity and upregulation of KC and MCP-1 in the spinal cord. Finally, single intravenous injection of LIG attenuated intrathecal injection of LPS-induced mechanical allodynia. The same treatment also decreased LPS-induced NFκB activation and KC and MCP-1 upregulation in the spinal cord. These data indicate that LIG attenuates chronic inflammatory pain potentially via inhibiting NFκB-mediated chemokines production in spinal astrocytes. These results provide direct evidence of the anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of LIG, suggesting a new application of LIG for the treatment of chronic inflammatory pain.",

In this study, the rat pancreatic acini AR42J cells were chosen as the research object, the application of hyla induced pancreatic acinar cells made model for acute pancreatitis, application of different concentrations of angelica peony spread effect on building cells, thus divided into control group, built in the module, the low concentration group, concentration and high concentration groups, determined by MTT method was applied to explore the above categories in cell proliferation, cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry, the expression of inflammatory factors in cell supernatant was determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay, and the expression of autophagy marker proteins LC3- ? and P62 was determined by Western-Bolt method. In order to explore the relationship between AMPK and SIRT1, immunoco-precipitation method was used to determine the interaction between AMPK and SIRT1, and dual luciferase experiment was used to explore the effect of AMPK on SIRT1. The AICAR group, BLM-275 group and negative control group were established. To explore the effect of SIRT1 on AMPK, we established SRT 1720 group, EX-527 group and control group. Direct binding between AMPK and SIRT1 should be determined by chromatin co-precipitation assay. In order to further explore the effect of AMPK/SIRT1 positive feedback loop on the systemic inflammatory response of acute pancreatitis, this study selected the medium-concentration Danggui Shaoyajiao SAN group as the control group (group C), and applied AMPK inhibitor BLM-275 and SIRT1 inhibitor EX 527 to the effect of medium-concentration Danggui Shaoyajiao SAN cells, respectively. The expression of autophagy marker proteins LC3- ? and P62 in groups A and B were determined by the Western-Bolt method. Results showed that compared with the control group, the cell survival rate, the expression of AMPK, SIRT1 and LC3-II in the model group were decreased, and the apoptosis rate of iNOS, IL-2, TNF-?, P62 and apoptosis were increased in the model group (P<0.05). the levels of iNOS, IL-2, TNF-?, P62 and cell survival rate in low, medium and high concentration groups decreased gradually, while the expressions of AMPK, SIRT1, LC3-II and cell apoptosis rate increased (P<0.05). The levels of iNOS, IL-2 and TNF-? in the three groups were gradually decreased with the increase of the concentration (P<0.05). Immunoprecipitation showed that AMPK and SIRT1 could bind to each other in cells. The double luciferase experiment indicated that the reporter gene containing the SIRT1 binding site was constructed. The luciferase activity was increased in THE AICAR group and decreased in the BLM-275 group (P<0.05). The reporter gene containing the AMPK promoter binding site was constructed. The luciferase activity in SRT1720 group was increased, while that in EX-527 group was decreased. SIRT1 could directly bind to the AMPK promoter. SIRT1 and LC3- ? protein expressions in group A were down-regulated, and P62 protein was increased (P<0.05). The protein expressions of AMPK and LC3- ? in group B were down-regulated, and the protein expression of P62 was increased (P<0.05). It concluded that AMPK can directly bind to activate SIRT1 expression, and SIRT1 expression can also activate AMPK, forming a positive feedback loop between the two. Therefore, Angelic Shaoyaodong decoction can mediate AMPK/SIRT1 positive feedback pathway to promote autophagy and regulate systemic inflammatory response in acute pancreatitis.",

            "content": "Chronic renal ischemia and hypoxia in the tubulointerstitium are involved in the mechanisms of progressive chronic kidney disease. Previous studies showed that the decoction of a combination of two Chinese herbs, Astragalus membmnaceus var. mongholicus and Angelica sinensis (A & A) has antifibrotic effects through multiple pathways in different animal models. In this study, remnant kidney model was employed to investigate whether A & A affect the expression of VEGF, the density of the renal microvasculature and thus alleviate the renal injury. Rats were divided randomly into four groups: sham group (N-31), 5/6 Nx group (5/ 6 nephrectomy, N=43), A & A treated group (A & A group, N=40, A & A 12 g/kg/d po), enalapril treated group (Ena group, N=56, enalapril 4 mg/kg/d po). Rats from each group were sacrificed at the 2th, 4th, 8th and 12th weeks respectively after surgery and treatment The 24 h urinary protein excretion, serum creatinine (Scr) and urea were measured. The collagen IV (COL-IV), fibronectin (FN), aminopeptidase P (APP) and VEGF were stained using immunohistochemistry. The COL-IV, FN and APP were semi-quantitatively analyzed. Peritubular capillary density in the cortical interstitial area was quantified. The level of VEGF was assayed by ELISA. The results revealed that Scr, urea and urinary protein excretion remained constant at each time point in sham group. Compared to sham group, 5/6 Nx group was shown severe glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial lesions and vascular damage, as well as higher level of Scr from the 2nd week (72.3 +/- 5.2 vs. 48.6 +/- 2.6 micromol/L P < 0.05) to the 12th week (71.9 +/- 8.0 vs. 55.7 +/- 4.5 micromol/L P < 0.05). Although there was no significant difference in Scr level after treatment of enalapril or A & A (P > 0.05), kidney damage was alleviated at the 8th and the 12th week in the two treatment groups (P < 0.05, vs. 5/6 Nx group). The urinary protein excretion of 5/6 Nx group was significantly increased from the 4th week, it was 1.5, 2.4 and 3.8 fold of that of sham group at the 4th, 8th and 12th week, respectively. Compared to 5/6 Nx group, proteinuria was decreased by enalapril to 59%, 33% at 8th and 12th week. After A & A administration, urinary protein excretion decreased to 66%, 56%, 75%, 55% of 5/6 Nx group at the 2nd, 4th, 8th and 12th, respectively (P < 0.05). Compared with sham group, there was increased expression of FN and COL-IV in rats with 5/6 Nx. After A & A or enalapril administration, the expression of FN and COL-IV was significantly decreased compared with that in the 5/6 Nx group at 8th and 12th week (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the capillary density was decreased at the 8th and 12th week in 5/6 Nx rats (P < 0.01). In A & A-treated group, similarly with enalapril group, the amount of APP-positive glomerular capillary increased by 36% (P < 0.01), and the peritubular capillary density was increased 94% at 8th week and 52% at 12th week compared with 5/6 Nx group (P < 0.05). The renal level of VEGF was decreased in 5/6 Nx rats, but increased at the 8th and 12th week in A & A group (P < 0.05, vs. 5/6 Nx group). In conclusion, A & A has renoprotective effects by suppression of extra cellular matrix deposition in 5/6 Nx rat. The renoprotective effects may be associated with reduction of proteinuria, up-regulation of VEGF which may reduce the loss of capillaries and improve microstructure dysfunction.",

Polysaccharides are important chemical substances of AS. These compounds effectively treat liver diseases, shows hepatoprotectivity, and contributes directly to the therapeutic effect of AS. However, the precise molecular mechanism of the effects of the different AS products polysaccharide has not been comprehensively explored. The present investigation was designed to assess the effects and possible mechanisms of polysaccharide in the different AS products against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury.,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Liver injury was induced by intraperitoneal injection with Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in the mice. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combined with pattern recognition approaches, namely, principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), were used to determine differentiating metabolites in plasma and liver tissue.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      PCA and PLS-DA score plots of the liver injury group clustered separately from that of the control, while groups treated with polysaccharides from charred AS (ASTP), parching AS with soil (ASTUP), parching AS with wine (ASJP), parching AS with Sesame Oil (ASYP) clustered closely with the control. This result indicates that the metabolic profiles of the ASTP, ASTUP, ASJP, and ASYP groups are almost similar to those of the control. Potential metabolite biomarkers (six in the liver homogenates and seven in the plasma) were identified. These biomarkers include citric acid, succinic acid,glycine, palmitelaidic acid, arachidonic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, valine, ananine, and hexadecanoic acid. Functional pathway analysis revealed that alterations in these metabolites are associated with lipid, amino acid, and energy metabolism. Notably, ASTP exhibited a potential pharmacological effect by regulating multiple perturbed pathways to the normal state.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      It is likely that ASTP, ASTUP, ASJP, ASYP intervenes the metabolic process of liver injury mice by affecting the lipid and amino acid metabolism. Metabonomics is a robust and promising for the identification of biomarkers and elucidation of the mechanisms of a disease, thereby highlighting its importance in drug discovery.",

Ligustilide (LIG) is the main component of the volatile oil isolated and purified from Angelica sinensis. LIG exerts many pharmacological activities, but its effects on osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption are still unclear. Our study showed that LIG inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand-induced OC formation and activation in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, LIG downregulated the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of OC-specific genes, such as V-ATPase d2, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, a dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein, cathepsin K, and nuclear factor of activated T cells cl. Furthermore, LIG blocked the activation of NF-κB/extracellular signal-regulated kinase/p38/immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif signaling pathways. Crucially, the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 proteins and the expression of receptor activator of NF-κB mRNA were inhibited by LIG. However, LIG did not affect the formation and mineralization of osteoblasts. Collectively, this observation suggests that LIG may serve as a promising agent for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by abnormal bone resorption.",

The expression levels of myofibroblast marker, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), fibronectin and type 1 collagen A1 were decreased after exposure of BP. Moreover, we found that the EMT-related markers, Twist, Snail and ZEB1 were all downregulated after BP treatment. Most importantly, our findings demonstrated that BP impeded the binding of Snail to the E-box region in the α-SMA promoter, which may lead to inhibition of the arecoline-induced myofibroblast activities. Collectively, our data indicated that BP reduced numerous myofibroblast features in fBMFs and hindered the binding of Snail to α-SMA, thereby may function as an effective and natural antifibrosis compound.",

EIU rats were administered orally with saline, LIG (20 mg/kg/day), and LIGNE (20 mg LIG /kg/day), respectively. Twenty-four hours later, rats were euthanized, and blood was collected from either right marginal ear vein to estimate inflammatory cells and inflammatory mediators. The drug dissolution profiles of LIGNE in both phosphate buffer pH 6.8 and 0.1 N HCl showed complete dissolution within 20 min. Pharmacokinetic studies suggested a significant increase (P < 0.0001) in the C pmax and AUC0→24 h were observed in the LIGNE group when compared with the LIG group. LIGNE significantly reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 beta, vascular endothelial growth factor alpha, and interleukin-17.

The present study further investigated the effect of LIG on chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Male Wistar rats were subjected to permanent ligation of both common carotid arteries (2VO). On Days 8-12 postsurgery, rat cognition was assessed in the Morris water maze. Rats with significantly impaired acquisition of spatial information were randomly allocated to three groups and orally administered LIG (10 or 40 mg/kg/day) or volume-matched vehicle on Days 13-40 post-2VO surgery. The sham-operated group served as controls. After long-term treatment with LIG, the impaired animals' behavioral, biochemical, and histopathological features were examined. Compared to the sham-operated group, significant cognitive impairment was observed in the vehicle-treated group 40 days after 2VO. Shortened mean escape latency was detected in the Morris water maze in rats treated with LIG (p<0.01 vs. vehicle-treated group) during the same trial days. Chronic 2VO-induced pathological changes included neuronal loss and an increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive astrocytes in the hippocampus. These effects were prevented with LIG treatment (p<0.01 vs. vehicle-treated group). LIG also significantly reduced malondialdehyde levels and increased superoxide dismutase activity in ischemic brain tissue (p<0.05 and p<0.01 vs. vehicle-treated group). In addition, LIG significantly increased choline acetyltransferase activity and inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity in ischemic brain tissues (p<0.05 and p<0.01 vs. vehicle-treated group). The present data demonstrate that LIG significantly prevented chronically hypoperfused cognitive deficits and brain damage at least partly through an antioxidant effect and improved cholinergic activity. The present findings suggest that LIG may have therapeutic potential in treating vascular dementia and cerebrovascular insufficiency.",

Phthalides, originating from XueBiJing's component herbs Ligusticum chuanxiong rhizomes and Angelica sinensis roots, are believed to contribute to its therapeutic effects due to their presence in the preparation and antisepsis-related properties. This investigation aimed to identify potential therapeutic phthalides that are bioavailable to act on XueBiJing's therapeutic targets and that could serve as pharmacokinetic markers to supplement classic biomarkers for sepsis care. Among 10 phthalides detected in XueBiJing, senkyunolides I and G were the major circulating phthalides in human subjects, but their different pharmacokinetics might influence their contribution to XueBiJing's therapeutic action. Senkyunolide I exhibited a large distribution volume (1.32 l/kg) and was moderately bound in plasma (54% unbound), whereas senkyunolide G exhibited a small distribution volume (0.10 l/kg) and was extensively bound in plasma (3% unbound). Clearance of senkyunolide I from the systemic circulation was governed by UGT2B15-mediated hepatic glucuronidation; the resulting electrophilic glucuronides were conjugated with glutathione in the liver. Senkyunolide G was selectively bound to albumin (99%) in human plasma. To our knowledge, the human pharmacokinetic data of XueBiJing's phthalides are reported here for the first time. Based on this investigation and such investigations of the other component herbs, follow-up pharmacodynamic assessments of bioavailable herbal compounds are planned to elucidate XueBiJing's chemical basis responsible for its therapeutic action. Senkyunolides I and G, having the preceding disposition characteristics that could be detectably altered by septic pathophysiology, could serve as pharmacokinetic markers for sepsis care.",

It was demonstrated that ASP significantly reduced hepcidin expression by inhibiting the expression of mothers against decapentaplegic protein 4 (SMAD4) in liver and stimulating the secretion of erythropoietin, which further downregulated hepcidin by repressing CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/5.

            "content": "It has been reported that an extract from Angelica sinensis mainly consisting of polysaccharides (95%) prevented ethanol- or indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal damage (Cho CH et al. Planta Med 2000;66:348-51). However, it is not known whether Angelica sinensis has a direct stimulatory effect on the healing of gastric mucosal lesions. To study the hypothesis that Angelica sinensis has a direct mucosal healing effect in rats and in isolated gastric epithelial cells, we assessed the wound repair in both animals and normal cell culture (RGM-1), as well as [3H]thymidine incorporation, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, and ODC protein and c-Myc protein expression after different treatments in RGM-1 cells. We found that Angelica sinensis crude extract (ASCE) dose-dependently enhanced gastric ulcer healing in rats and promoted wound repair in RGM-1 cells. It also significantly stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation and ODC activity in RGM-1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. ODC and c-Myc protein expression was also increased as a result of this process. DL-alpha-difluoromethyl-ornithine repressed the [3H]thymidine incorporation and ODC activity induced by ASCE. Pretreatment with c-Myc antisense oligodeoxynucleotides blocked the stimulatory action of ASCE on [3H]thymidine incorporation and ODC protein expression. These data suggest that ASCE has a direct mucosal healing effect on gastric epithelial cells, while ODC and c-Myc are closely associated with this effect.",

The results showed that aqueous extracts of these crude drugs exhibited antioxidant activities in a concentration-dependent manner. All extracts displayed an inhibitory effect on FeCl2-ascorbic acid induced lipid peroxidation in rat liver homogenate in vitro, with the order of activity LB > AS > PC. The tested extracts showed a superoxide anion scavenging activity ranging from 28.8% to 82.2% and anti-superoxide activity varying from 38.0% to 84.5%. Among the different extracts, LB extract exhibited the lowest IC50 values (0.77-2.55 microg/mL) in all model systems tested in this study. The present study concludes that LB extract possessed the strongest inhibition on malondialdehyde formation in rat liver homogenate, and superoxide anion scavenging and anti-superoxide formation activities. These results also suggest that LB extract is a good source of antioxidant agent in the daily dietary supplement.",

            "content": "Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) plays a critical role in treating cancer patients. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is the main component of CAM. TCM, especially Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM), has been increasingly used in China, some other Asian countries and European countries. It has been proven to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted-therapy, and immunotherapy. It lessens the damage caused by these therapies. CHM functions on cancer by inhibiting tumor progression and improving an organism's immune system. Increasing evidence has shown that many CHM exert favorable effects on the immune regulation. We will summarize the role of CHM on patient's immune system when treating cancer patients. Our evidence reveals that single herbs, including their extracts, compound formulations, and preparations, will provide current advances on CHM study, especially from the perspective of immune regulation and novel insights for CHM application in clinic. The main herbs used to treat cancer patients are health-strengthening (Fu-Zheng) herbs and pathogen eliminating (Qu-Xie) herbs. The key mechanism is regulating the immune system of cancer patients. Firstly, health-strengthening herbs are mainly functioned as immune regulatory effectors on cancer. Secondly, some of the compound formulations mainly strengthen the health of patients by regulating the immune system of cancer patients. Lastly, some Chinese medicine preparations are widely used to treat cancer for their properties of spiriting vital energy and anti-cancer effects, mainly by improving immunity. CHM plays a positive role in regulating patients' immune system, which helps cancer patients to fight against cancer itself and finally improves patients' life quality.",

            "content": "Epigenetic alteration of DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression associated with chemosensitivity of human hepatocellular (HCC) carcinoma cells. With the aim of improving the chemotherapeutic efficacy for HCC, the effect of the naturally occurring compound n-butylidenephthalide (BP), which is isolated from a chloroform extract of Angelica sinensis, was investigated. In both HepG2 and J5 HCC cell lines, a synergistic antiproliferative effect was observed when a low dosage of BP was combined with the chemotherapeutic drug 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU). BCNU is an alkylating agent, and it prompts us to examine one of DNA repair genes, O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT). It was evident from methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis that BP/BCNU combined treatment caused a time- and concentration-dependent enhancement of MGMT promoter methylation. Overexpression of MGMT could abolish BP-induced growth inhibition in the J5 tumor cell line as measured by colony formation assay. When BP was combined with BCNU and administered, it showed significant antitumor effects in both HepG2 and J5 xenograft tumors as compared with the use of only one of these drugs. The BCNU-induced apoptosis and inhibited MGMT protein expression in HCC cells, both in vitro and in vivo, resulting from the combination treatment of BP and BCNU suggest a potential clinical use of this compound for improving the prognosis for HCCs.",

Factors including temperature, light, pH value, co-solvents and antioxidants can all influence the stability of Z-ligustilide, thereinto antioxidants could markedly improve its stability in aqueous solution by almost 35%. The suitable vehicle for Z-ligustilide contains 1.5% tween-80, 0.3% Vitamin C, and 20% propylene glycol (PG). Furthermore, the degradation rates of Z-ligustilide were found to conform to a rate equation following Weibull probability distribution within a range of degradation ratio, and the equation could be expressed as follow: ln ln (1/1-alpha) = ln k + m ln t. Where alpha is degradation ratio; t is time; m and k are constants relating to the degradation rate. The degradation rate will get greater as the increasing of parameter k. According to the degradation law obtained from the equation, the drug shelf-life (10% of active ingredient degraded, T90) in this vehicle was predicted to be more than 1.77 years at 25 degrees C through Arrehenius equation and accelerating experiments. The present investigation was undertaken to propose a kinetic treatment that may be applicable to any type of degradation of the active ingredient of pharmaceutical formulation, and also could provide a good foundation for the new drug development of Z-ligustilide, especially for injection formulation.",

It is used to promote blood flow and has been used in the treatment of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in animal models. Angiotensin II (Ang II) has been shown to play important roles in mediating cardiovascular diseases, and may cause cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate whether Danggui has protective effects on Ang II-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells and study the mechanisms involved.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      We evaluated the effect of Danggui on Ang II-induced apoptosis in an in vitro model. H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 4 hr, then treated with Danggui (50, 100 μg/ml) 1 hr pre- or post-Ang II treatment. After a further 23 hr of culture, cells were harvested for analyses with assays for apoptosis markers and cell signaling pathways.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Our results showed that Ang II induced upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bad, instability of the mitochondria membrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Pre- or post-treatment with Danggui reversed all of the above Ang II-induced apoptotic effects in H9c2 cells. Furthermore, the JNK (SP600125) inhibitor completely blocked Danggui inhibition of caspase-3 activation in Ang II-treated H9c2 cells.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Our results showed that Danggui either pre-treatment or post-treatment highly attenuated the Ang II-induced apoptosis in cardiomyoblast cells.

However, the effectiveness of AS on atopic dermatitis (AD) has not been reported yet. This study was conducted to evaluate the antipruritic and anti-inflammatory effects of AS on regulating AD-related mediators in DNCB (2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene)-induced mice. AS was topically applied to the dorsal skin of DNCB-challenged mice for 11 days. Alteration of skin thickness was measured for assessment of histological improvement. In addition, the number of mast cells, the level of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), the counting of scratching behavior, and the expression of substance P were evaluated. Also, the expressions of cytokines, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), phospho-IκBα, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were measured for evaluating the improvement of skin inflammation. The repeated treatment of AS significantly inhibited the skin thickness, the number of mast cells, and the level of serum IgE. Moreover, AS significantly suppressed the increased scratching behavior and the expression of substance P compared to the DNCB group. Topical application of AS also reduced the level of cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) as well as the expressions of NF-κB, phospho-IκBα, and phospho-MAPKs in the dorsal skin. The results of our study suggest that topical application of AS might have efficacy for modulating pruritus and inflammation in AD. Further studies are required to further characterize the mechanism of actions of AS.",

From the panel of positive hits, Angelica sinensis was selected for further investigation.

In both models, SBD.4A compared favorably with the Food and Drug Administration-approved wound-healing drug becaplermin, suggesting that this botanical product could be a valuable treatment for difficult-to-heal wounds. Further high-performance liquid chromatography fractionation of SBD.4A yielded a hydrophilic fraction, which strongly stimulated endothelial cell proliferation, tridimensional endothelial cell network formation, as well as the proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts and type I collagen secretion. Because angiogenesis and fibroblast proliferation are essential for wound healing, we propose that this liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-defined hydrophilic fraction is at least partially responsible for the wound-healing activity of SBD.4A.",

Rats were given 0.698g/kg YHP, 0.07g/kg tetrahydropalmatine (THP; YHP's main component), 0.02g/kg imperatorin (IMP), or THP+IMP (0.07+0.02g/kg) as polypharmacy (PG) by gavage. H&E staining and histopathological examination of the uteri tissue samples were performed. We then detected superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), i-κB, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) indices.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      PG significantly inhibited the uterine contraction of the primary dysmenorrhea rat model (p<0.05), and was significantly different than single-agent therapy (p<0.05). Histopathological examination showed inflammation in the uteri of the control group which YHP and its main constitutes alleviated. THP significantly inhibited the contraction of isolated uteri caused by Ach, PGF2α and oxytocin in a concentration-dependent fashion. THP and IMP both significantly affected the levels of NO, activation of NF-κB, up-regulated the expression of i-κB and down-regulated the expression of both iNOS and COX-2.

The combined strategy proved to be more effective than either THP or IMP alone and may have synergistic effects in combination in primary dysmenorrhea. Mechanisms that might account for the beneficial effects include abating oxidative stress, inhibiting over-inflammatory reaction, and alleviating the contraction of isolated rat uteri by inhibiting the influx of extracellular Ca(2+).

To recapitulate the AD cell model, DS induced pluripotent stem cells (DS-iPSCs), reprogrammed from mesenchymal stem cells in amniotic fluid, were directed toward a neuronal lineage. Neuroepithelial precursor cells with high purity and forebrain characteristics were robustly generated on day 10 (D10) of differentiation. Accumulated amyloid deposits, Tau protein hyperphosphorylation and Tau intracellular redistribution emerged rapidly in DS neurons within 45 days but not in normal embryonic stem cell-derived neurons.

Interestingly, we found that F127-Bdph showed significant therapeutic effects in reducing secreted Aβ40 deposits, the total Tau level and the hyperphosphorylated status of Tau in DS neurons. Taken together, DS-iPSC derived neural cells can serve as an ideal cellular model of DS and AD and have potential for high-throughput screening of candidate drugs.

            "content": "Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT), a herbal decoction contains Astragali Radix (AR) and Angelicae Sinensis Radix (ASR), has been used as a health food supplement in treating menopausal irregularity in women for more than 800 years in China. Several lines of evidence indicate that the synergistic actions of AR and ASR in this herbal decoction leading to a better pharmacological effect of DBT. Here, the role of different herbs in directing the transport of active ingredients of DBT was determined. A validated RRLC-QQQ-MS/MS method was applied to determinate the permeability of ingredients across the Caco-2 cell monolayer. AR-derived chemicals, including astragaloside IV, calycosin and formononetin, as well as ASR-derived chemicals, including ferulic acid and ligustilide, were determined by RRLC-QQQ-MS/MS. The pharmacokinetic results showed that the membrane permeabilities of calycosin and formononetin, two of the major flavonoids in AR, could be markedly increased in the presence of ASR extract: this induction effect could be mediated by ferulic acid deriving from ASR. In contrast, the extract of AR showed no effect on the chemical permeability. The current results suggested that the ingredients of ASR (such as ferulic acid) could enhance the membrane permeability of AR-derived formononetin and calycosin in cultured Caco-2 cells. The possibility of herb-drug synergy within DBT was proposed here.",

            "content": "This investigation was designed to determine the inhibitory effects and mechanisms of n-butylidenephthalide (BP) from Angelica sinensis on smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in vitro and in balloon injured rat carotid artery. Treatment of cultured rat aorta SMC-derived A7r5 cells with 25-100 μg/mL BP significantly inhibited the proliferation and arrested the cell cycle in G(0)/G(1) phase. BP induced the expression and migration of Nur77 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Among signal pathways, JNK and p38 MAPK were phosphorylated after BP treatment. In vivo, the neointimal area of common carotid artery 2 weeks after balloon injury reduced significantly in Sprague-Dawley rats treated with 150-300 mg/kg BP compared with the control. The proliferative activity indicated by immunohistochemical detection of Ki-67 positive cells in the neointima was significantly decreased in the 60-300 mg/kg BP treatment groups. The apoptotic activity indicated by cleaved caspase-3 positive cells and Nur77 positive cells in the neointima was significantly increased in rats treated with 60-300 mg/kg BP. This study demonstrated BP inhibited neointimal hyperplasia in balloon injured rat carotid artery due to its dual effects of proliferative inhibition and apoptotic induction on SMCs. Up-regulation of Nur77 gene may partly explain the antihyperplasia activity of BP on the neointima.",

Women who are going through the menopause transition can experience physiological symptoms that significantly impact their quality of life. Concern about adverse effects of traditional hormone therapy often leads women to purchase over-the-counter (OTC) natural health products (NHPs). The goal of this study was toinvestigate the range of OTC NHPs for menopause available to Canadian women, and the packaging information they can access to make self-management decisions.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Edmonton stores belonging to each of nine Canadian pharmacy chains were visited to identify NHPs marketed for the relief of menopausal symptoms. Details were extracted from the packaging: a) product name and manufacturer, b) Health Canada license number, c) medically active ingredients, d) claims of efficacy, e) contra-indications and warnings, and f) daily cost. Data were entered and analyzed using Microsoft Excel.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      We identified 20 OTC NHP menopausal products, 19 of which had Health Canada license numbers. Twenty-eight medically active ingredients were identified, with the most common being black cohosh (in 14 products) and soy isoflavones (n = 7), chaste tree (n = 5), and dong quai (n = 3). Most products claimed they would relieve vasomotor symptoms, including hot flashes (n = 14) and night sweats (n = 10). Each product had a labeled contraindication for at least one specific condition. Costs per recommended daily dose ranged from $0.07 to a maximum of $2.50 (CAD$).,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Natural health products for menopausal symptoms are easily available to Canadian women. The lack of clear evidence of product efficacy makes the need for easily accessible, balanced information on this topic important for women to make well informed choices.",

            "content": "Angelica sinensis polysaccharides were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR). The major sugar of the polysaccharide was saccharose (18.55%); and the sugar constituted about 83% of the monomer content. Glucose and fructose were found as minor components of the polysaccharides. The FT-IR spectra of A. sinensis polysaccharides are used for determination of their structural features. The FT-IR spectrum of A. sinensis polysaccharides showed bands at 1641 cm(-1), 1415 cm(-1), 1050 cm(-1) and 926 cm(-1) characteristic for the carboxylic group. Absorptions at 2920-2930 cm(-1) are attributed to asymmetrical stretching vibration of CH(2)-group. Medium stretch observed in the range 1650-1400 cm(-1) is assigned to C-C stretching of polysaccharides. Cardioprotective effects of A. sinensis polysaccharides were evaluated by using myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (IR) rats. A. sinensis polysaccharides treatment significantly reduced myocardial infarction size, enhanced CT-1 and antioxidant enzymes activity, downregulated caspase-12 mRNA expression in rats.

This neuroprotective effect was associated with enhancement of synaptic efficacy by improving field excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes, alleviating adverse alterations in the structure of synapses and neurons in the hippocampus, and increasing the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, microtubule-associated protein-2, and synaptophysin in the hippocampus.

Previous studies found that these two herbs could increase myocardial blood flow, oxygen-supply and keep myocardial oxygen balance, etc. However, the mechanisms of angiogenic effects of these two herbs are not well-known. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of Angelica and ChuanXiong on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in rat myocardial infarction, on endothelial cell proliferation and quantity of vessels on chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). In this study, rats were divided randomly into either pre-treatment or acute-treatment group and sacrificed at the end of the treatments. VEGF expression using Western blot analysis was significantly increased in the groups pre-treated with ChuanXiong and Angelica when compared to the control group (p < 0.05). There was significant increase in VEGF expression in the rats treated acutely with Angelica (p < 0.05). In the contrary, the rats treated with ChuanXiong showed a decrease in VEGF expression when compared to the acute-treatment control group (p < 0.05). Similar results were observed in immunohistochemistry of VEGF expression in the myocardia. Our study also demonstrated that these two herbs significantly enhanced endothelial cell proliferation (p < 0.05) and revascularity in CAM (p < 0.05). The data showed that Angelica and ChuanXiong could affect VEGF expression in rat myocardial infarction, promote endothelial cell proliferation and stimulate quantity of vessels on CAM model. The results suggest that Angelica and ChuanXiong have angiogenic effects, and may provide some mechanisms for the treatment of myocardial infarction and peripheral ischemia.",

It has been reported that the acetone extract of Angelica sinensis (AE-AS) rich in phthalides is able to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. However, whether AE-AS reduces cancer angiogenesis remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that AE-AS significantly inhibited the angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo evidenced by attenuation of the tube formation in hypoxic human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs), and the vasculature generation in Matrigel plug, the chicken chorioallantoic membrane, and tumors. Treatment with AE-AS markedly decreased the protein accumulation and transcriptional activity of HIF-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression/secretion, and VEGFR2 phosphorylation in hypoxic human bladder cancer (T24) cells and tumor tissues accompanied by a reduction of tumor growth. Notably, AE-AS-induced HIF-1α protein degradation may, at least partly, attribute to inhibition of WSB-1-dependent pVHL degradation. Moreover, VEGFR2-activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in hypoxic T24 cells was greatly inhibited by AE-AS. Collectively, AE-AS may be a potential anticancer agent by attenuating cancer angiogenesis via suppression of WSB-1/pVHL/HIF-1α/VEGF/VEGFR2 cascade.",

The use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMS) has increased many-fold over the past decade. Although several compelling studies show renal toxicities and an adverse outcome from use of some CAMS, there is also emerging evidence in the literature that some may be renoprotective. Many nephrologists are unaware of these potential therapeutic benefits in treating CKD, or they are reluctant to consider them in research trials for fear of adverse effects (including nephrotoxicity) or deleterious interaction with co-prescribed, conventional medicines. The increased use of self-prescribed CAMS by their patients suggests that practitioners and researchers should keep abreast of the current information on these agents. A primary goal of this article was to review the available scientific evidence for the use of herbs or natural substances as a complementary treatment for patients with CKD. A further goal was to report the literature on herbs that have been reported to cause kidney failure.",

EPCs were exposed to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL, 10 µg/mL, 24 h) and incubated with or without high-dose (100 µg/mL, 48 h) or low-dose (20 µg/mL, 48 h) ASP. Another group of EPCs was pre-treated with Wortmannin (100 nM, 45 min), a PI3K/Akt inhibitor. EPC senescence, telomerase activity, and superoxide anion levels were assessed using SA-β-galactosidase staining, telomerase PCR-ELISA analysis, and DHE staining, respectively. The expression of related proteins, including Akt, p-Akt, hTERT, p-hTERT, and gp91phox, were detected using western blot.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      EPCs (47.3%) were SA-β-gal positive after treatment by ox-LDL, additionally, ox-LDL significantly increased superoxide anion levels (375% versus 100%), and inhibited telomerase activity (42% versus 100%). However, the pro-senescent effect of ox-LDL was attenuated about three-fold (16.7%), superoxide anion levels were decreased more than two-fold (148%), and telomerase activity was recovered partly (88% versus 42%) in the EPCs when treated with ASP (100 µg/mL). The immunoblotting confirmed that ASP attenuated inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and hTERT induced by ox-LDL and down-regulated increased the expression of gp91-phox. Moreover, some effects of ASP were partially abrogated in the presence of Wortmannin.,Discussion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Ox-LDL induced senescence of EPCs via inhibition of telomerase activity, which was influenced by oxidative stress and the Akt/hTERT pathway. The inhibition of EPC senescence by ASP could be important for potential therapeutics.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Treatment of EPCs with ASP remarkably attenuates the harmful effects of ox-LDL via augmentation of Akt/hTERT phosphorylation and inhibition of oxidative stress.",

            "content": "The root of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (abbreviated as AS) (Danggui) has a long history in Asian herbal medicine. Recently, it was demonstrated that AS possesses anti-cancer and anti-oxidant activities. Because the transcription factor Nrf2 mediates the expression of many cellular anti-oxidative stress genes, including genes that are involved in phase II drug metabolism and anti-oxidative stress, this study sought to investigate whether pure compounds from AS or an AS extract could activate antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated gene expression and induce anti-inflammatory activities. Z-Ligustilide (Ligu), 3-butylidenephthalide (Buty) and CO2 supercritical fluid-extracted lipophilic AS extract (SFE) were tested in HepG2-C8 cells stabilized with ARE luciferase reporter gene. Ligu and Buty caused significant toxicity only at 100 μm. All three samples induced ARE-luciferase activity; however, SFE at 8.5 µg/ml induced ARE-luciferase activity 2-3 fold more potently than did either of the pure compounds. SFE also significantly increased the endogenous mRNA of Nrf2 and the Nrf2 target anti-oxidative gene NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 (NQO1). The protein expression of NQO1 was also significantly induced by SFE. In RAW 264.7 cells, SFE suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-1β and TNF-α expression about 2 fold stronger than sulforaphane, whereas both pure compounds and SFE suppressed inflammatory nitric oxide (NO) production. In summary, this study demonstrates that AS has anti-inflammatory effects and activates the Nrf2 pathway, which protects against oxidative stress.",

In this study, we found that ASCE promoted ulcer healing. The area of the ulcer was reduced. This was accompanied with a significant increase in mucus synthesis when compared with the control. Angiogenesis was inhibited by the treatment of ASCE. Cell proliferation, ODC and EGFR protein expression was not affected in this process. Thus, the mechanism of how ASCE accelerates ulcer healing in addition to its effect on mucus synthesis remains to be investigated.",

However, no reports can be found on its application in the treatment of oral cancers. We are therefore interested in whether Chingwaysan is capable of causing abnormal apoptosis processes, and whether this condition can be rectified through Chingwaysan herb treatment. We used aqueous extract to treat OC2 and TSCCa cells (both are human oral cancer cell lines) with different Chingwaysan concentrations (0, 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 microl/ml). The MTT (3, (4, 5-dimethyl-thiazol) 2, 5-diphenyl-tetraxolium bromide) reduction assay was employed to quantify the differences in cell activity and viability. DNA ladder formation on agarose electrophoresis was also performed. The bax expression level was monitored using immunoblotting techniques. The patterns of the changes in expression were scanned and analyzed by NIH image 1.56 software. Taken together, drastic morphological changes, reduced cell viability and the presence of inter-nucleosomal DNA fragmentation all indicated that Chingwaysan is capable of inducing apoptosis in OC2 and TSCCa cell lines. Furthermore, the accumulation of wild type bax protein significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner upon treatment with Chingwaysan. In conclusion, Chingwaysan can induce apoptosis via a bax-dependent pathway in cells from these two particular oral cancer cell lines.",

Our results demonstrated that FrA pretreatment at doses of 80  mg/kg (FrA-80  mg) and 100  mg/kg (FrA-100  mg) effectively ameliorated neurological functions and reduced the numbers of cytochrome c-, cleaved caspase-3-, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in the penumbral cortex 3 d after ischemia.

The results showed that LIG significantly ameliorated inhibition of bone formation in zebrafish caused by prednisolone. LIG promoted osteoblast differentiation, including that of the pre-osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. LIG greatly improved the viability of MC3T3-E1 cells exposed to H2O2, attenuated H2O2-induced apoptosis and increased the expression of Bcl-2. Furthermore, LIG treatment lead to marked activation of phosphorylated EGFR and ERK1/2. These effects could be obviously inhibited by blocking GPR30 signaling with the specific inhibitor G15.

AS extract strongly inhibited p38, ERK, JNK, p65 phosphorylation and I-κB degradation in RANKL-stimulated BMMs. AS extract also inhibited the mRNA expression of c-Fos, c-Jun, NFATc1, TRAP, and OSCAR in RANKL-treated BMMs. Moreover, RANKL-induced c-Fos, c-Jun and NFATc1 protein expression was suppressed by AS extract.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      These results collectively suggested that AS extract demonstrated inhibitory effects on RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation in bone marrow macrophages in vitro, indicating that AS may therefore serve as a useful drug in the prevention of bone loss.",

Based on previous studies, we explored the hair growth effect and the mechanism of A. sinensis related to keratinocyte apoptosis-regression during catagen in mice. The 70% Ethanol extract of A. sinensis was applied topically at doses of 1 and 100 mg/mL to the dorsa of C57BL/6 mice for 2 weeks. The A. sinensis-treated group showed noticeable hair regrowth. Treatment with A. sinensis restored the lengths of hair shafts and size of hair follicles. In addition, mice treated with A. sinensis showed notably decreased apoptotic cells, along with a significant change in the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and the ratio of a pair of apoptosis-associated proteins: Bcl-2 and Bax. Also, A. sinensis inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, the phosphorylation of IκB-α, the phosphorylation of three mitogen-activated protein MAP kinases, and the activation of c-Jun with decreased TNF-α. These findings reveal a role of A. sinensis as an alternative treatment for hair loss that acts through hair cycle pathways associated with apoptosis regression during catagen.",

It was observed that fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels in both models were reduced after a 4-week oral administration of ASP or metformin, and abnormal fasting serum insulin (FINS) concentrations were ameliorated as well. Moreover, the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index was decreased strikingly and body weight (BW) was reduced significantly in prediabetic mice after treatment with ASP. In addition, ASP also contributed to improving the dyslipidemia conditions. Elevated serum total cholesterol (TC) or triglyceride (TG) concentrations were reduced after treatment with ASP in prediabetic mice or STZ-induced diabetic mice. Meanwhile, hepatic glycogen (HG) and muscle glycogen (MG) concentrations were increased while insulin resistance (IR)-related inflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF-α in serum were reduced in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Histopathological examination indicated that the impaired pancreatic/hepatic tissues or adipose tissues were effectively restored in STZ-induced diabetic mice or prediabetic mice after the ASP treatment. Taken together, these results revealed that ASP efficiently exerted hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic benefits, and its potential effect was associated with the amelioration of IR. ASP can be applied in the prevention and treatment of diabetes.",

Diels, also known as &ldquo;female ginseng&rdquo;, is a popular herbal drug amongst women, used to treat a variety of health issues and cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the detailed molecular mechanism for anti-inflammatory effects of Angelica sinensis root water extract (ASW). The anti-inflammatory effect of ASW on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages was evaluated by the tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay (MTT), Griess reagent assay, multiplex cytokine assay, real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Fluo-4 calcium assay. ASW restored cell viability in RAW 264.7 at concentrations of up to 200 &micro;g/mL. ASW showed notable anti-inflammatory effects.

Light microscopic analyses showed a porous or an eroded appearance on the tibial trabecular bone surface in OVX rats, whereas those of the sham and DGJHY-administered OVX rats were composed of fine particles. The trabecular bone area and the trabecular thickness in OVX rats were significantly lower than those of sham rats. Moreover, these reductions in OVX rats were significantly reversed by the administration of DGJHY for 7 weeks, and osteoclast numbers were also significantly reduced. Although no differences were observed between OVX and DGJHY-administered OVX rats and the sham animals at the T3 level, we have found significant differences between these two groups at the T4 level. However, serum phosphorus, calcium, mechanical strength and the surface appearance of osteoblasts in the DGJHY-administered OVX rats were similar to those of OVX rats.

Despite its rarity among the various stroke types, SAH is still responsible for approximately 25% of all stroke fatalities. Although various preventative and therapeutic interventions have been explored for potential neuroprotection after SAH, a considerable percentage of patients still experience serious neurologic and/or cognitive impairments as a result of the primary hemorrhage and/or secondary brain damage that occurs. Z-ligustilide (LIG), the primary lipophilic component of the Chinese traditional medicine radix Angelica sinensis, has been shown to reduce ischemic brain injury via antiapoptotic pathways. Accordingly, in our study, we investigated the neuroprotective potential of LIG after experimental SAH in rats. Rats with SAH that was induced using the established double hemorrhage model were studied with and without LIG treatment. Mortality, neurobehavioral evaluation, brain water content, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and vasospasm assessment of the basilar artery were measured on days 3 and 7 after injury. Additional testing was done to evaluate for apoptosis using TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling staining as well as immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to identify key proapoptotic/survival proteins, i.e., p53, Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3. The results showed that LIG treatment reduced mortality, neurobehavioral deficits, brain edema, BBB permeability, and cerebral vasospasm. In addition, treatment reduced the number of apoptotic cells in the surrounding brain injury site, which accompanied a marked down-regulation of proapoptotic proteins, p53, and cleaved caspase-3. Our data suggest that LIG may be an effective therapeutic modality for SAH victims by altering apoptotic mechanisms.",

Forty-two rabbits were randomized into 6 groups: normal group, LPS group, dexamethasone group (5 mg/kg), and 3 ligustilide groups (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg). After the rabbits had received a LPS infusion (0.3 mg/kg), dexamethasone and ligustilide were intravenously injected at the above-mentioned dosages. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and rectal temperature (RT) were recorded throughout the experiment. Tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α), interleukin-1 β (IL-1 β), and nitric oxide (NO) levels were measured by radioimmunoassay every 30 minutes for the first hour and every 60 minutes thereafter until the end of the experiment. The serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), creatinine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein (TP), creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total bilirubin (T. BIL), and counts of formed elements of blood were measured at 0, 120, and 300 minutes after the administration of LPS. Hemorheology was assayed 300 minutes after the LPS injection. The vital organs were collected and weighed before histopathologic examination. A comparison between the LPS group and the ligustilide groups showed that ligustilide significantly inhibited the decline in MAP and RT and decreased the levels of TNF- α, IL-1 β, and NO, but had no apparent effect on HR. Ligustilide also inhibited the increase in the levels of biochemical markers, such as ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, LDH, CK, BUN, and Scr, but showed no apparent effect on T. BIL and TP. Furthermore, ligustilide partly restored the function of injured vital organs, including the heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys. These results suggest that ligustilide protected the rabbits against LPS-induced endotoxic shock.",

A. sinensis optimal formula (AOF) is the best combination in A. sinensis that has been screened to rescue the cognitive ability in β-amyloid peptide (Aβ25-35)-treated Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of AOF on the learning and memory of AD rats as well as to explore the underlying mechanisms.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Male Wistar rats were infused with Aβ25-35 for AD model induction or saline (negative control). Five groups of AD rats were fed on AOF at 20, 40, or 80 mL/kg every day, donepezil at 0.9 mg/kg every day (positive control), or an equal volume of water (AD model) intragastrically once a day for 4 weeks, while the negative control rats were fed on water. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate the cognitive function of the rats. The Aβ accumulation, cholinergic levels, and antioxidative ability were detected by ELISA. Additionally, the candidate mechanism was determined by gene sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The results showed that AOF administration significantly ameliorated Aβ25-35-induced memory impairment. AOF decreased the levels of amyloid-β precursor protein and Aβ in the hippocampus, rescued the cholinergic levels, increased the activity of superoxide dismutase, and decreased the malondialdehyde level. In addition, AOF inhibited the expression of IL1b, Mpo, and Prkcg in the hippocampus.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      These experimental findings illustrate that AOF prevents the decrease in cognitive function and Aβ deposits in Aβ25-35-treated rats via modulating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, thus highlighting a potential therapeutic avenue to promote the co-administration of formulas that act on different nodes to maximize beneficial effects and minimize negative side effects.",

Traditionally, boiling water has been used for preparing DBT; however, the optimized conditions of extraction have not yet been determined. Here, the amounts of Radix Astragali-derived astragaloside IV, calycosin, formononetin, and Radix Angelicae Sinensis-derived ferulic acid and ligustilide were determined in DBT, which were extracted according to an orthogonal array experimental design having three variable parameters: extraction time, extraction volume and number of repeats of the extraction. Our results suggest that extraction time and number of repeats of the extraction are two crucial factors, while extraction volume is a subordinate factor. The optimized conditions for extraction were therefore established. Besides the chemical composition, the estrogenic and anti-platelet aggregation activities of DBT were determined in different groups of the extraction, and the results of bioassays were in line with the amounts of the analyzed chemical ingredients.

Our previous studies have indicated that Gui-Hong has therapeutic potential treatment in hemolytic and aplastic anemia (HAA). The present study aimed to investigate the hematinic effects of Danggui, Honghua and Gui-Hong on HAA rats induced by acetyl phenylhydrazine (APH) and cyclophosphamide (CP) and to explore the underlying hematinic regulation mechanisms.,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Rats were divided into 5 groups, and drugs were administered by oral gavage one time each day for continuous 7 days from the experiment began. Urine and plasma were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS). Partial least-squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) models were built to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Danggui, Honghua and Gui-Hong. Pearson correlation matrix analysis method was used to discover the correlations between potential biomarkers and biochemical indicators of HAA rats.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Seven potential biomarkers contribute to the separation of model group and control group were tentatively identified. The levels of l-kynurenine, phenylalanine, nicotinic acid and sphingosine increased significantly (P<0.05) in HAA rats, while the levels of l-isoleucine, l-tyrosine and serotonin decreased significantly (P<0.05) in comparison with control rats. Those endogenous metabolites were chiefly involved in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, tryptophan metabolism and tyrosine metabolism. The metabolic deviations could be regulated closer to normal level after Danggui, Honghua and Gui-Hong intervention. In term of hematinic effects, Gui-Hong was the most effective as shown by the relative distance in PLS-DA score plots and relative intensity of potential biomarkers. The result reflected the synergic action between Danggui and Honghua. The above results were found to be reasonable in explaining the hematinic effects mechanism of Gui-Hong.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The results of routine blood, urinary metabolic pattern and plasma metabolic pattern show the Danggui, Honghua and Gui-Hong groups are moving toward the control group and the HAA was being prevented and alleviated. The effect of Gui-Hong group is more remarkable than Danggui and Honghua groups. Some potential biomarkers like l-kynurenine, phenylalanine, l-isoleucine, l-tyrosine, serotonin, nicotinic acid and sphingosine have been found and identified. The work shows that the metabonomics method is a promising tool in the efficacy and mechanism research of traditional Chinese medicines.",

Diels (ASE) on the growth and differentiation of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (CFU-GM) in normal and Listeria monocytogenes-infected mice were studied. Myelosuppression concomitant with increased numbers of spleen CFU-GM was observed in infected mice. Prophylactic administration of ASE (10, 25, and 50 mg/kg) stimulated marrow myelopoiesis in a dose-dependent manner and reduced spleen colony formation to control values. The dose of 50 mg/kg ASE was the optimal biologically active dose in infected mice, and this dose schedule significantly increased survival of mice infected with a lethal dose of L. monocytogenes, with survival rate up to 30%. Investigation of the production of colony-stimulating factors revealed a dose-dependent increased colony-stimulating activity in the serum of infected mice, with higher response produced by the 50 mg/kg dose. Notably, no effects were observed with the 100 mg/kg dose, compared with infected nontreated controls. Further studies to investigate the production of factors such as inteferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α demonstrated increased levels of both cytokines in mice infected with L. monocytogenes and treated with 50 mg/kg ASE. We propose that ASE indirectly modulates immune activity and probably disengages Listeria-induced suppression of these responses by inducing a higher reserve of myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow in consequence of biologically active cytokine release (colony-stimulating factors, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α).",

            "content": "The decoction of a combination of two Chinese herbs, Astragali Radix (the roots of Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus) and Angelicae Sinensis Radix (the roots of Angelica sinensis), here named as A&A, has been demonstrated to have renoprotective effects in several animal models and may be considered as a complementary therapeutic medicine for chronic kidney disease. In this study, genomic approaches were employed to identify expression signatures in the obstructed kidney, which may be linked to the molecular actions associated with anti-fibrotic effects of A&A. Ninety-six male Wistar rats were divided randomly into sham, SAA (sham + A&A), UUO (unilateral ureteral obstruction), and UAA (UUO + A&A) groups. The rats in the SAA and UAA groups were administered A&A (14 g/kg) by oral gavage once daily; the ones in the sham and UUO groups were given equal volumes of water. Eight rats from each group were sacrificed at days 3, 7, and 10 after the operation, respectively. Changes in gene expression in the kidneys were determined using Affymetrix RAE-230A GeneChips. The differential expression of known genes between UAA and UUO was confirmed by RT-PCR. The results revealed that 40, 65, and 104 genes were upregulated and 30, 36, and 40 genes downregulated in UUO compared with the sham group at days 3, 7, and 10, respectively. Compared to the UUO group, eight genes were upregulated and two genes were downregulated at day 3 in the UAA group, and two genes were upregulated at day 10. These genes included transient receptor protein 3 (TRP3), bone marrow stromal cell antigen 1 (BST-1), peroxisomal biogenesis factor 6 (PEX6), xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), cytochrome P450 subfamily I member A1 (CYP1A1), serine/cysteine proteinase inhibitor clade E member1 (PAI-1), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and five ESTs. Among these genes, differential expression of PAI-1, FGF23, and CYP1A1 were further confirmed by RT-PCR. These data provide the evidence that the anti-fibrotic effects of A&A are mediated through multiple pathways in obstructive nephropathy, and novel mechanisms may be involved in the increasing degeneration of ECM, decreasing ROS reaction, and regulation of the calcium-phosphate metabolism.",

The extracts of Radix Angelicae Sinensis (RAS), Radix Paeoniae Alba (RPA) and Radix Angelicae Sinensis-Radix Paeoniae Alba herb couple (RRHC) were orally administrated to rats, respectively. The concentrations of ferulic acid, caffeic acid, vanillic acid, ligustilide, paeoniflorin, albiflorin and oxypaeoniflorin in rat plasma and the concentrations of ferulic acid, vanillic acid, paeoniflorin, albiflorin and oxypaeoniflorin in tissues were determined by UPLC-MS/MS. The plasma samples were pretreated by protein precipitation with methanol and the tissue samples were homogenated with water and pretreated by protein precipitation with methanol. Chromatographic separation was performed on a C18 column using 0.1% formic acid-acetonitrile as mobile phase for gradient elution. A triple quadrupole (TQ) tandem mass spectrometry equipped with an electrospray ionization source was used as detector operating both in positive and negative ionization mode and operated by multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) scanning. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by DAS 2.0 program. The differences between each group were compared by SPSS 16.0 with Independent-Samples T-test. The pharmacokinetic parameters (such as Cmax, Tmax, T1/2, AUC0-T, MRT0-T, Vz/F or CLz/F) of all the detected components between the single herb (RAS or RPA) and herb pair (RRHP) showed significant differences (P<0.05). It indicated that the compatibility of RAS and RPA could alter the pharmacokinetics features of each component. Tissue distribution results showed that ferulic acid, vanillic acid, paeoniflorin, albiflorin and oxypaeoniflorin mostly distributed in liver and kidney both in herb couple and single herb distributed most in liver and kidney. Compared with single herb, RRHC could increase or decrease the concentrations of five components at different time points compared with the sing herb. The results indicated the method was successfully applied to the comparative study on pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of different combination of RRHC in rats. The compatibility of two Chinese herbs could alter the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution properties of major bio-active components in the single herb.

            "content": "Androgen and androgen receptor (AR) signaling are crucial for the genesis of prostate cancer (PCa), which can often develop into androgen-ligand-independent diseases that are lethal to the patients. Recent studies show that even these hormone-refractory PCa require ligand-independent AR signaling for survival. As current chemotherapy is largely ineffective for PCa and has serious toxic sideeffects, we have initiated a collaborative effort to identify and develop novel, safe and naturally occurring agents that target AR signaling from Oriental medicinal herbs for the chemoprevention and treatment of PCa. We highlight our discovery of decursin from an Oriental formula containing Korean Angelica gigas Nakai (Dang Gui) root as a novel anti-androgen/AR agent. We have identified the following mechanisms to account for the specific anti-AR actions: rapid block of AR nuclear translocation, inhibition of binding of 5alpha-dihydrotestesterone to AR and increased proteasomal degradation of AR protein. Furthermore, decursin lacks the agonist activity of the \"pure\" anti-androgen bicalutamide and is more potent than bicalutamide in inducing PCa apoptosis. Structure-activity analyses reveal a critical requirement of the side-chain on decursin or its structural isomer decursinol angelate for anti-AR, cell cycle arrest and proapoptotic activities. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using activity-guided fractionation in cell culture assays combined with mechanistic studies to identify novel anti-androgen/ AR agents from complex herbal mixtures.",

Our results demonstrate that in PD animal models, n-butylidenephthalide significantly attenuates dopaminergic neuron degeneration induced by 6-hydroxydopamine; reduces α-synuclein accumulation; recovers lipid content, food-sensing behavior, and dopamine levels; and prolongs life-span of 6-hydroxydopamine treatment, thus revealing its potential as a possible antiparkinsonian drug. n-Butylidenephthalide may exert its effects by blocking egl-1 expression to inhibit apoptosis pathways and by raising rpn-6 expression to enhance the activity of proteasomes.,Conclusions/significance:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      n-Butylidenephthalide may be one of the effective neuroprotective agents for PD.",

However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study was designed to determine the effects of QDTM on endothelial cells under hypoxic conditions both in vitro and in vivo. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated, pretreated with QDTM medicated serum or saline control, and then cultured under hypoxia (2% oxygen) for 24 h. Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 1 ml/100 g of QDTM or saline twice a day for 4 days and treated with hypoxia (6 hours/day, discontinuous hypoxia, 360 mm Hg). QDTM not only protected HUVECs from hypoxia-induced damage by significantly retaining cell viability (P < 0.05) and decreasing apoptosis (P < 0.05) in vitro, but also protected liver endothelial cells from hypoxia-induced damage in vivo. Moreover, QDTM increased the serum VEGF-A level (P < 0.05) in rats treated with hypoxia for 7 days but suppressed the upregulation of serum VEGF-A in rats treated with hypoxia for 14 days. QDTM is a potent preparation that can protect endothelial cells against hypoxia-induced damage. The ability of QDTM to modulate the serum VEGF-A level may play an important role in its effects on endothelial cells.",

Hypothesis/Purpose: To assess the therapeutic value of DGLHT for the treatment of psoriasis, a Th1 and/or Th17 cell-mediated inflammatory skin disease, and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      An in vivo mouse model of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like inflammation was used to investigate the effect of DGLHT. The anti-inflammatory effects of an ethanolic extract of DGLHT (DGLHT-E) and the mechanism responsible were examined in an in vitro model using IL-1α, IL-17A, IL-22, oncostatin M, plus TNF-α (M5) stimulated HaCaT cells. The anti-proliferative effect of DGLHT-E was examined by analyzing the expression levels of K16, K17 and Ki67 in IL-22 stimulated HaCaT cells.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Topical application of 1% DGLHT-E significantly reduced psoriasis-like symptoms including scaling and epidermal hyperplasia in IMQ-treated mice. Immunohistochemical studies showed that DGLHT-E exerted potent anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting IL-22 production in local skin lesions. DGLHT-E also attenuated the productions of CXCL10 and CCL20 in M5-stimulated HaCaT cells by suppressing the ERK1/2, JNK and STAT3 signaling pathways. Furthermore, berberine hydrochloride, a primary constituent of DGLHT-E inhibited the expressions of the proliferation markers K16 and K17 in IL-22 stimulated HaCaT cells.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      These results suggested that DGLHT-E offers a possible treatment for psoriasis, and that berberine hydrochloride might be a useful component of ointment-based treatments for psoriatic lesions.",

Growth suppression of malignant brain tumor cells by AS-C results from cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. AS-C can up-regulate expression of cdk inhibitors, including p21, to decrease phosphorylation of Rb proteins resulting in cell arrest at the G0-G1 phase for DBTRG-05MG and RG2 cells. The apoptosis-associated proteins are dramatically increased and activated in DBTRG-05MG cells and RG2 cells by AS-C but RG2 cells without p53 protein expression. In vitro results showed AS-C triggered both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways for apoptosis.

The present study was undertaken to characterize the effects of this preparation on diabetic nephropathy using streptozotocin-diabetic rats as a model. Streptozotocin-dependent alterations in renal weight/body weight ratio, urinary albumin and beta (2)-microglobulin concentrations, urinary albumin excretion rate, and creatinine clearance were ameliorated after eight weeks of treatment with either DBT or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, benazepril. DBT, but not benazepril, partially attenuated the increases in blood glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol in STZ-diabetic rats. Additionally, the increased expression of transforming growth factor-beta (1) mRNA in the renal cortex due to streptozotocin-induced diabetes was modestly attenuated by these treatments. However, eight weeks of treatment with DBT failed to modify the concentration of angiotensin II in plasma or kidney, indicating that the ability of the preparation to retard the progression of kidney disease was not attributable to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. We propose that DBT alleviates renal alterations in diabetes and slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy by suppressing transforming growth factor-beta (1) mRNA expression. The preparation may therefore be useful as an adjuvant therapy for controlling diabetes and its complications.",

The antidepressant effects of PAPZ were investigated with a corticosterone (CORT) model of depression in mice. Our results showed that administration of PAPZ ameliorated depression-like phenotypes in the CORT model. An anatomic study showed that chronic PAPZ administration upregulated the protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampal tissue. The enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase was enhanced in hippocampal tissue, in line with a decreased malondialdehyde level. Taken together, these findings suggested that PAPZ has therapeutic effects in a mice depression model through increasing protein expression of BDNF and improving the anti-oxidation ability of the brain.",

In vitro, GBM cells were treated with BP, and the effects of proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were determined. In vivo, DBTRG-05MG, the human GBM tumor, and RG2, the rat GBM tumor, were injected subcutaneously or intracerebrally with BP. The effects on tumor growth were determined by tumor volumes, magnetic resonance imaging and survival rate. Here, we report on the potency of BP in suppressing growth of malignant brain tumor cells without simultaneous fibroblast cytotocixity. BP up-regulated the expression of Cyclin Kinase Inhibitor (CKI), including p21 and p27, to decrease phosphorylation of Rb proteins, and down-regulated the cell-cycle regulators, resulting in cell arrest at the G(0)/G(1) phase for DBTRG-05MG and RG2 cells, respectively. The apoptosis-associated proteins were dramatically increased and activated by BP in DBTRG-05MG cells and RG2 cells, but RG2 cells did not express p53 protein. In vitro results showed that BP triggered both p53-dependent and independent pathways for apoptosis. In vivo, BP not only suppressed growth of subcutaneous rat and human brain tumors but also, reduced the volume of GBM tumors in situ, significantly prolonging survival rate.

            "content": "The Th17/Treg axis plays a crucial role in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) and might represent an interesting drug target of treatment strategy for these diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests a role for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the modulation of Th17/Treg axis, but a comprehensive overview which summarizes this field hitherto is lacked. This paper performs a systematic literature review of the regulatory effects of TCM on the imbalance of Th17/Treg axis and its potential mechanisms. In addition, the frequency analysis and network pharmacology for the collected TCM herbs from clinical trial data were performed. The studies reported the changes in the ratio of Th17 and/or Treg cells as well as their transcription factor and related cytokines were included. Frequency analysis of composition of the 39 assessed TCM prescriptions showed that Astragalus membranaceus var.mongholicus (5.20%), Glycyrrhiza uralensis (3.67%), Paeonia obovate (3.06%), Salvia digitaloides (3.06%), and Angelica sinensis (2.75%) were the top five herbal components, which were closely associated to the treatment of IMID. Network pharmacology showed that six target proteins (transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta receptor type-1, TGF-beta receptor type-2, retineic-acid-receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma (ROR-gamma), TGFB2, IL-17 and IL-2, respectively) might be involved in the regulatory effects of TCM on Th17/Treg axis. Moreover, there were nine active ingredients (including Oxymatrine, Baicalin, Triptolide, Paeoniflorin, Sinomenine, Celastrol, Emodin, Diosgenin and Chlorogenic acid) originating from TCM reported to have an immunological regulation effect on the Th17/Treg axis. The highlight of this systematic review is to reveal the pharmacological basis of TCM treating IMID and is helpful for supporting future pharmacologic-driven studies. Further research elucidates the immune-modulating mechanisms on Th17/Treg axis by TCM might provide a broader insight for the treatment of IMID.",

Thymol is a volatile aromatic compound with antiinflammatory properties. As a model for dairy cows, 5 healthy, lactating alpine dairy goats were given 5 mL of Phyto-Mast per udder half. For 10 d following treatment, we analyzed blood and milk samples for thymol residues using GC-MS. The GC-MS assay was very sensitive for thymol detection, to a concentration of 0.01 μg/mL in plasma. Using thymol as a marker, Phyto-Mast was detectable and quantifiable in plasma beginning with the 15-min posttreatment sample, but was no longer detectable in the 4-h posttreatment sample. Thymol residues were only detected in the 12-h posttreatment milk sample. An inflammatory response was not evident in the udder following phytoceutical administration. Although this study provides information about the elimination of thymol, the product contains several other active chemicals, which may have different pharmacokinetic behaviors. Further analysis and additional study animals will help to determine a milk withholding time for Phyto-Mast. Given the recent growth of the organic dairy industry, understanding the pharmacokinetics of therapeutics used in organic production and developing accurate withholding recommendations will help to ensure milk safety.",

Pharmacological results indicate that DBT can stimulate the production of erythropoietin (EPO), a specific hematopoietic growth factor, in cultured cells.,Aim of the study:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      In order to reveal the mechanism of DBT's hematopoietic function, this study investigated the activity of the DBT-induced EPO expression and the upstream regulatory cascade of EPO via hypoxia-induced signaling in cultured kidney fibroblasts (HEK293T).,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      DBT-induced mRNA expressions were revealed by real-time PCR, while the change of protein expressions were analyzed by Western blotting. For the analysis of hypoxia-dependent signaling, a luciferase reporter was used to report the transcriptional activity of hypoxia response element (HRE).,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The plasmid containing HRE, being transfected into HEK293T, was highly responsive to the challenge of DBT application. To account for the transcriptional activation of HRE, DBT treatment was shown to increase the mRNA and protein expressions of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). In addition, the activation of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway by DBT could also enhance the translation of HIF-1α, suggesting the dual actions of DBT in stimulating the EPO expression in kidney cells.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Our study indicates that HIF pathway plays an essential role in directing DBT-induced EPO expression in kidney. These results provide one of the molecular mechanisms of this ancient herbal decoction for its hematopoietic function.",

It contains chemically active compounds like pyranocoumarins, polyacetylenes and essential oils, which might be useful for treatment of several chronic diseases. It has been used for centuries as a traditional medicine in Southeast Asia, but in Western countries is used as a functional food and a major ingredient of several herbal products. The genus Angelica is also known as 'female ginseng' due to its critical therapeutic role in female afflictions, such as gynecological problems. However, it is well-documented that the AGN pyranocoumarins may play vital beneficial roles against cancer, neurodisorders, inflammation, osteoporosis, amnesia, allergies, depression, fungi, diabetes, ischemia, dermatitis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and androgen. Though numerous studies revealed the role of AGN pyranocoumarins as therapeutic agents, none of the reviews have published their molecular mechanism of action. To the best of our knowledge, this would be the first review that aims to appraise the biosynthesis of AGN's major active pyranocoumarins, discuss effective extraction and formulation methods, and detail the molecular action mechanism of decursin (D), decursinol angelate (DA) and decursinol (DOH) in chronic diseases, which would further help extension of research in this area.",

Estimated IC(50)-values were determined for the extracts that produced significant inhibition (less than 100 microg ml(-1)). Inhibition of CYP2C19 by dong quai (IC(50) = 13.7-14.3 microg ml(-1) for the methanolic extract) and CYP2D6 by goldenseal (IC(50) = 6.7 and 6.3 microg ml(-1) for the aqueous and methanolic extracts, respectively), are of particular concern as the potential for adverse interactions is high.

In this study, immune-induced AA mice were used as an animal model, and the immunosuppressive agent, Ciclosporin A (CsA), was used as a positive control. Multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines were examined by bead-based multiplex flow cytometry. The T-cell subsets were assessed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Western blot analysis was used to estimate the protein expression levels of specific transcription factors for T helper cells (Th1, Th2 and Th17) and key molecules of the Janus-activated kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat3) signaling pathway. DGBX treatment could significantly increase the production of whole blood cells in peripheral blood (PB); inhibit the expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells; increase the differentiation of Th2 and Tregs cells; regulate the expression levels of T-bet, GATA-3, RORγ and proinflammatory cytokines; and decrease the expression levels of key molecules in the Jak/Stat signaling pathway. These results indicate that DGBX can regulate the differentiation of T lymphocytes, resulting in immunosuppressive and hematogenic functions on AA mice. DGBX might be a good candidate for inclusion in a randomized study for AA with more data on the possible side effects and doses used in humans.

Pulmonary fibrosis was induced by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (5 mg/kg) in Wistar rats. Subsequently, the rats received daily intragastric administration of DBTG (16, 32 or 64 mg/kg per day) or cortisone (3 mg/kg) 1 day after bleomycin instillation for 4 weeks. Histological changes in the lung were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining. Markers of fibrosis in serum were determined by radioimmunoassay. The mRNA expression of metalloproteinases 1 and 9 (MMP-1, MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) in lung tissue were detected by reverse transcription PCR.,Key findings:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      DBTG administration attenuated the degree of alveolitis and lung fibrosis, and markedly reduced the elevated levels of hyaluronic acid, laminin, type III procollagen and type IV collagen in serum. DBTG decreased the mRNA levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1. MMP-1 expression was only moderately decreased by DBTG.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      DBTG had an inhibitory effect on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and its effect may be associated with the ability of DBTG to inhibit the synthesis of extracellular matrix and balance the MMP/TIMP-1 system.",

Currently, EF is thought to cause recurrent postoperative pain after laminectomy or after discectomy. Angelica sinensis is a traditional Chinese medicine which has shown anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and antiproliferative properties. The object of this study was to investigate the effects of Angelica sinensis on the prevention of post-laminectomy EF formation in a rat model. A controlled double-blinded study was conducted in sixty healthy adult Wistar rats that underwent laminectomy at the L1-L2 levels. They were divided randomly into 3 groups according to the treatment method, with 20 in each group: (1) Angelica sinensis treatment group, (2) saline treatment group, and (3) sham group (laminectomy without treatment). All rats were euthanized humanely 4 weeks after laminectomy. The hydroxyproline content, Rydell score, vimentin cells density, fibroblasts density, inflammatory cells density, and inflammatory factors expressions all suggested better results in Angelica sinensis group than the other two groups. Topical application of Angelica sinensis could inhibit fibroblasts proliferation and TGF- β 1 and IL-6 expressions and prevent epidural scar adhesion in postlaminectomy rat model.",

The results showed that microwave vacuum drying can significantly shorten the drying time and improved the drying efficiency. Six different mathematical models were investigated and the Midilli model was the best-fitted model for all samples (R2 = 0.99903, Pearson's r = 0.99952), and drying methods had various effects on different indexes and were confirmed by Pearson's correlation analysis and principal component analysis.

Diels reaches 20%-60%, which seriously affects its food and medicinal qualities. Thus, differences in gene expression between the flower bud and sprout-shoot apical meristem underwent analysis, by means of cDNA-amplified restriction fragment length polymorphism, to better understand the flowering mechanism. 64 primer sets, each of which amplified to 60 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs), were used. Among these TDFs, 26 were expressed specifically in the flower bud. After cloning and sequencing, 32 distinct sequences were obtained from these 26 TDFs, and 25 were found with homologous sequences in databases. Confirmation of differential expression of 13 sequences was obtained by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, their showing higher expression levels in flower buds. These homologous sequences encode transposable elements, pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins, DNA-binding transcription factors, zinc finger (B-box type) family proteins, NADP-dependent sorbitol 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (S6PDH), amongst others.",

            "content": "Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimens are recommended for patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). However, oxaliplatin (OXA) can cause toxic side effects at the recommended dosage. Therefore, it is necessary to find new drug candidates that can synergize with OXA and thereby lower the OXA dose while still maintaining its efficacy. Angelica sinensis is a common drug in traditional Chinese medicine and has demonstrated a significant anti-CRC effect in modern pharmacological studies. The active ingredients in Angelica sinensis can be effectively extracted by a supercritical fluid extract. In this study, the supercritical fluid extract of Angelica sinensis (A-SFE) was obtained by a stable extraction process and was chemically characterized by GC/MS. The anti-cancer effect of A-SFE when applied individually was explored in vitro through MTT, scratch, and Transwell assay. The effect of A-SFE on CRC cells under the influence of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) was explored by a co-culture model. The results showed that A-SFE could inhibit the viability, metastasis, and invasion of HCT116 cells, especially under the influence of TAMs. When 20-100 μg/ml of A-SFE and 8-64 μg/ml of OXA were used in combination in HCT116 cells, synergistic or additive effects were shown in different concentration combinations. The CT26 syngeneic mouse model was used to explore the anti-CRC effect of OXA combined with A-SFE in vivo. The tumor volume, expression levels of Ki67, MMP9, and CD206 in the OXA + A-SFE group were less than those in the OXA group. In conclusion, A-SFE has the potential to become an adjuvant drug for OXA in the treatment of CRC, which provides new strategies for anti-colorectal cancer research.",

The interaction between root and rhizosphere microorganisms is crucial for the growth and quality formation of medicinal plants.

Here, we collected roots and rhizosphere soils from A. sinensis in seedling stage (M) and picking stage (G), respectively cultivated for one year and two years, generated metabolite for roots, microbiota data for rhizospheres, and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Changes in metabolic and microbial communities of A.sinensis over growth were distinct. The composition of rhizosphere microbes in G was dominated by proteobacteria, which had a strong correlation with the synthesis of organic acids, while in M was dominated by Actinobacteria, which had a strong correlation with the synthesis of phthalide and other organoheterocyclic compounds, flavonoids, amines, and fatty acid. Additionally, co-occurrence network analysis identified that Arthrobacter was found to be strongly correlated with the accumulation of senkyunolide A and n-butylidenephthalide. JGI 0001001.H03 was found to be strongly correlated with the accumulation of chlorogenic acid.

The mechanism by which A. sinensis exerts its effect is also discussed. A diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis model was established in 36 male Wistar rats by an endotracheal injection of bleomycin A5 (5 mg/kg). Then, these rats were randomly divided into the model group (n = 18) and the treatment group (treated with A. sinensis after modelling, n = 18). Control rats (n = 6) received an equal volume of saline. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was performed to analyse alveolitis and Masson staining, to observe pulmonary fibrosis. Collagen content was determined by hydroxyproline assay. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) expression at mRNA level was detected by northern blotting and at protein level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results obtained showed that the alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis of the rats treated with A. sinensis was significantly alleviated compared with that of the rats in the model group. Treatment with A. sinensis also lowered the content of collagen, decreased NF-κB activity in alveolar macrophages and reduced the TGF-β expression at the mRNA and protein level. These results indicated that A. sinensis is effective in treating and alleviating interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, possibly by lowering collagen, inhibiting the activity of NF-κB and reducing the TGF-β expression.",

Cytotoxic and proliferation-promoting concentrations of AS ethanol extracts (AS extract) and FA were tested, and then the cell extracts were subject to 2D PAGE analysis. We found 51 differentially expressed protein spots, and these were identified by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, biomolecular assays, involving collagen secretion, migration, and ROS measurements, gave results that are consistent with the proteomic analysis. In this work, we have demonstrated a whole range of pharmacological effects associated with Angelica sinensis that might be beneficial when developing a wound healing pharmaceutical formulation for the herbal medicine.",

Firstly, fish feeds were respectively added with EQ, and ethyl ether extract, ethyl acetate extract (EAE), acetone extract, ethanol extract (EE) and aqueous extract (AQE) of Angelica sinensis, except for the control. The results showed that EAs and EQ inhibited lipid oxidation in fish feeds (P < 0.05). Of all of the examined EAs, EAE showed the strongest protective effects against lipid oxidation (P < 0.05). Moreover, EAE at high concentrations showed a stronger effect on lipid oxidation compared with EQ (P < 0.05). Then, 7 experimental diets respectively supplemented with 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 g/kg of EAE were fed to the respective treatment groups for 30 d. Four replicates were performed for each treatment group; 20 carp (mean weight: 12.10 ± 0.13 g) were in each replicate. The results indicated that dietary EAE improved the growth performance in carp (P < 0.05). The appropriate concentration of EAE for carp growth was estimated to be 3.643 g/kg diet. Thus, EAE could be used as a natural antioxidant in feeds for Jian carp.",

There was no significant variation in the alpha-diversity of the bacterial and fungal communities, but significant variation was in the beta-diversity. We found that the variation of microbial community composition was accompanied by the changes in community function. The relative abundance of fungal pathogens increased with plant growth. We also identified the core microbes, significant-changing microbes, stage-specific microbes, and host-specific microbes. Plant weight, root length, root diameter, soil pH, rainfall, and climate temperature were the key divers to microbial community composition.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Our findings reported the variation and environmental drivers of rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities during the growth of A. sinensis seedlings, which enhance the understanding of the rhizosphere microbial community in this habitat.",

In this study, the pharmacological interaction in regulating cold-induced vascular smooth muscle cell contraction via cold-sensing protein TRPM8 and TRPA1 was analyzed between ferulic acid and Z-ligustilide. Pharmacological interaction on inhibiting [Ca(2+)]i influx evoked by TRPM8 agonist WS-12 or TRPA1 agonist ASP 7663 as well as cold-induced upregulation of TRPM8 was determined using isobolographic analysis. The isobolograms demonstrated that the combinations investigated in this study produced a synergistic interaction. Combination effect of two components in inhibiting RhoA activation and phosphorylation of MLC20 induced by WS-12 or ASP 7663 was also being quantified.

A rat model was prepared by intraperitoneal injection of hydrocortisone and isoproterenol plus cold stimulation. Each group was given corresponding decoction or distilled water for 14 days. The behavioral changes of rats in each group were observed. The morphological changes of rats cardiomyocytes were observed by HE staining. The average optical density (MOD value) and percentage of positive cells of Bcl-2, Bax, and Akt were determined by immunohistochemical staining method, and PEIs were calculated.

In the present study, we report a correlative analysis between rhizosphere microorganisms and phthalides accumulation in A. sinensis from Gansu, China where was the major production areas. Meanwhile, Bacillus was explored the potential functions in the plant growth and phthalide accumulation. Results revealed that the common bacterial species detected in six samples comprised 1150 OTUs which were involved in 368 genera, and predominant taxa include Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Proteobacteria. The average contents of the six phthalides were 4.0329 mg/g. The correlation analysis indicated that 20 high abundance strains showed positive or negative correlations with phthalides accumulation. Flavobacterium, Nitrospira, Gaiella, Bradyrhizobium, Mycobacterium, Bacillus, RB41, Blastococcus, Nocardioides, and Solirubrobacter may be the key strains that affect phthalides accumulation on the genus level. By the plant-bacterial co-culture and fermentation, Bacillus which were isolated from rhizosphere soils can promote the plant growth, biomass accumulation and increased the contents of the butylidenephthalide (36∼415%) while the ligustilide (12∼67%) was decreased. Altogether, there is an interaction between rhizosphere microorganisms and phthalides accumulation in A. sinensis, Bacillus could promote butylidenephthalide accumulation while inhibiting ligustilide accumulation.",

The EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) concluded that the additive is safe for horses and dogs at the maximum proposed use level of 123 and 481 mg/kg complete feed, respectively. For cats, the calculated safe concentration is 184 mg/kg complete feed. For the poultry species, the calculated safe concentration in water for drinking is 79 mg/kg for chickens for fattening, 117 mg/kg for laying hens and 106 mg/kg for turkeys for fattening. No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of dong quai tincture up to the highest safe levels in feed. The additive under assessment should be considered as irritant to skin and eyes, and as a dermal and respiratory sensitiser. The use of the dong quai tincture as a flavour in animal feed was not expected to pose a risk for the environment. Since the root of A. sinensis has flavouring properties and its function in feed would be essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is considered necessary.",

Our results show that bifendate, AAP, ASP, and AMP significantly decreased the activities of MDA, AST, and ALT, and enhanced the activity of SOD in CCl4-treated mice. Bifendate, AAP, ASP, and AMP consistently ameliorated the liver injuries induced with CCl4. Notably, the hepatoprotective effect of AAP was stronger than that of bifendate, ASP, or AMP. In addition, AAP alleviated liver inflammation and decreased the liver indexes of mice induced with CCl4. These effects were at least partly due to the antioxidant properties of AAP in scavenging free radicals to ameliorate oxidative stress and to inhibit lipid peroxidation.",

Therefore, in this study, the endophytic diversity of Angelica seeds was studied and compared with endophytes isolated from healthy leaves, stems, roots, and seeds of A. sinensis using 20 different media. The metabolites of endophytic strains were evaluated with six different methods for their antioxidant activity and the paper disc diffusion method for antimicrobial activities. As a result, 226 endophytes were isolated. Compared with the biodiversity and abundance of uncultured fungi from Angelica seed, the result showed that the most frequent endophytic fungi were Alternaria sp. as seen in artificial media; moreover, compared with artificial media, the pathogenic fungi, including Fusarium sp. and Pseudallescheria sp., were not found from the Angelica seed, the results suggested it may not be inherent endophytes in plants. In addition, bacteria from seven phyla were identified by high-throughput sequencing, while five phyla of endophytic bacteria were not isolated on artificial media including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Microgenomates, and Saccharibacteria. Furthermore, the sample JH-4 mycelium displayed the best antioxidant activity, and the active constituent may be a flavonoid as determined by total phenol and flavonoid content. Moreover, YH-12-1 mycelium had strong inhibitory activity against the five tested strains and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae was found to be 25 μg/mL.

            "content": "Angelica sinensis is a perennial rhizomatous herb that is widely used for the treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, which largely rely on metabolites, such as alkylphthalides, polysaccharides, and ferulic acid. This plant must experience low-temperature vernalization and long-day conditions for the occurrence of early bolting and flowering (EBF) that reduces yield and quality of fleshy root. In current commercial planting, the EBF of more than 40% is mainly attributed to the completion of vernalization of seedlings during overwinter storage. While effects of storage temperatures [vernalization temperature (0-10°C) and freezing temperature (-2 to -12°C)] and seedling sizes on the EBF have been observed in previous studies, the precise vernalization temperature and duration for different size seedlings, the effective freezing storage to avoid vernalization of seedlings, and physiological characteristics have not been systematically investigated. Here, the EBF rate, the anatomical structure of shoot apical meristem (SAM), and physiological characteristics of different size seedlings at different storage temperatures (0, 3, 5, -3, and -5°C) and durations (14-125 d) are reported. The vernalization duration of seedlings was predicated from 57 to 85 d with temperatures ranging from 0 to 5°C based on the linearization regression analysis via Matrix Laboratory software. The EBF can be effectively inhibited by freezing storage. The anatomical structure of SAM, levels of primary metabolites (soluble sugar, starch, amino acid, and protein), and endogenous hormones (GA3, IAA, and ABA), exhibited a dynamical change in the seedlings at different storage temperatures. These findings will provide useful information for predicting the vernalization of seedlings and inhibiting the EBF in large-scale commercial cultivation.",

            "content": "Angelica sinensis is a \"low-temperature and long-day\" perennial plant that produces bioactive compounds such as phthalides, organic acids, and polysaccharides for various types of clinical agents, including those with cardio-cerebrovascular, hepatoprotective, and immunomodulatory effects. To date, the regulatory mechanism of flowering under the photoperiod has been revealed, while the regulatory network of flowering genes during vernalization, especially in the role of lncRNAs, has yet to be identified. Here, lncRNAs associated with flowering were identified based on the full-length transcriptomic analysis of A. sinensis at vernalization and freezing temperatures, and the coexpressed mRNAs of lncRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR. We obtained a total of 2327 lncRNAs after assessing the protein-coding potential of coexpressed mRNAs, with 607 lncRNAs aligned against the TAIR database of model plant Arabidopsis, 345 lncRNAs identified, and 272 lncRNAs characterized on the SwissProt database. Based on the biological functions of coexpressed mRNAs, the 272 lncRNAs were divided into six categories: (1) chromatin, DNA/RNA and protein modification; (2) flowering; (3) stress response; (4) metabolism; (5) bio-signaling; and (6) energy and transport. The differential expression levels of representatively coexpressed mRNAs were almost consistent with the flowering of A. sinensis. It can be concluded that the flowering of A. sinensis is positively or negatively regulated by lncRNAs, which provides new insights into the regulation mechanism of the flowering of A. sinensis.",

A novel approach using biochemical parameters coupled with metabolomics based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and chemometrics was established in this study to explain the hepatoprotective effect mechanism of ASP. The superoxide dismutase activity, malonaldehyde content, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase in plasma were measured. Pathological changes in the liver were observed. Plasma and liver homogenate obtained from mice were analyzed using GC-MS. Distinct changes in metabolite patterns in the plasma and liver homogenate after being induced by carbon tetrachloride and drug intervention were observed using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA). Potential biomarkers were found using PLS-DA and T-test. The results of the pathological changes observed in the liver, the biochemical parameters in plasma, and the metabolomics of the plasma and liver homogenate all showed that liver injury was successfully reproduced, ASP exhibited hepatoprotective effect, and the medium dose of ASP exhibited the best. Nine endogenous metabolites in the liver homogenate and ten endogenous metabolites in the plasma were all considered as potential biomarkers. They were considered to be in response to hepatoprotective effects of ASP involved in the amino acids metabolism, energy metabolism, and lipids metabolism. Therefore metabolomics is a valuable tool in measuring the efficacy and mechanisms of action of traditional Chinese medicines.",

            "content": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the accumulation of lung fibroblasts and extracellular matrix deposition. Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP), the major bioactive component that can extracted from roots of angelica, plays functional roles in immunomodulation, anti-tumor activity, and hematopoiesis. Emerging evidence has suggested that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in pathophysiological processes in various diseases. However, the roles of lncRNAs and ASP in IPF remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ASP in IPF, as well as their functional interactions with lncRNA DANCR (differentiation antagonizing non-protein coding RNA). IPF models were established by treating Sprague-Dawley rats with BLM and treating alveolar type Ⅱ epithelial (RLE-6TN) cells with TGF-β1. Our results showed that ASP treatment suppressed pulmonary fibrosis in rats and fibrogenesis in RLE-6TN cells. The lncRNA DANCR is downregulated after ASP treatment in both rat lung tissues and RLE-6TN cells, and DANCR overexpression dramatically reversed the suppressive effects of ASP in IPF. Mechanistically, DANCR directly binds with AUF1 (AU-binding factor 1), thereby upregulating FOXO3 mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, overexpression of AUF1 or FOXO3 reversed the functional effects induced by ASP treatment. In conclusion, our findings showed that DANCR mediates ASP-induced suppression of IPF via upregulation of FOXO3 protein levels in an AUF1-dependent manner. Therefore, DANCR could serve as a promising therapeutic target in IPF treatment with ASP.",

The promising compound was identified as C-HMMP through antimicrobial-guided fraction. The structure of C-HMMP was unambiguously confirmed by 2D NMR and HIRS spectroscopic analysis. Antimicrobial property testing of C-HMMP showed it to be effective against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and fungi with MICs ranging from 3.9 to 31.25 μg/ml. The compound displayed excellent antibiofilm activity against C. albicans, S. aureus, and K. pneumonia. Furthermore, the antimalarial and radical scavenging activities of C-HMMP were clearly dose-dependent, with IC50 values of 0.15 and 131.2 µg/ml, respectively. The anti-proliferative activity of C-HMMP against the HepG-2, HeLa, and MCF-7 cell lines in vitro was investigated by MTT assay, revealing notable anti-proliferative activity with IC50 values of 114.1, 90, and 133.6 μg/ml, respectively. Moreover, C-HMMP successfully targets topoisomerase I and demonstrated beneficial anti-mutagenicity in the Ames test against the reactive carcinogenic mutagen, 2-aminofluorene (2- AF). Finally, the compound inhibited the activity of α-glucosidase and α-amylase with IC50 values of 144.7 and 118.6 μg/ml, respectively.

In this study, we have investigated the antagonistic effect of ASP on 5-FU-induced injury of mouse spleen in vivo and splenocytes in vitro, and its possible mechanism. Our results showed that ASP inhibited 5-FU-induced decreases in spleen weight and organ index in mice, restored the number of peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphocytes, repaired spleen structure disorder and functional impairment, rescued serum IL-2, IL-6, and IFN-γ levels, and relieved 5-FU-induced mitochondrial swelling， reduced the oxidant accumulation including MDA and ROS, whereas increasing the activities of GSH, SOD and CAT. The mechanism may be related to ASP downregulation of Keap1 protein expression thus motivating the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Furthermore, ASP alleviated the apoptosis of spleens in vivo and splenocytes in vitro, and reactivated PI3K / AKT signalling. In conclusion, the protective effect of ASP on spleens and splenocytes may be related to the reduction of oxidative stress and apoptosis via reactivation of Nrf2 and PI3K/AKT pathways. This study has provided a new protective agent for minimizing the spleen injury caused by 5-FU and a new idea for improving the prognosis of chemotherapy patients.",

            "content": "Intercropping is a sustainable method for cultivating medicinal herbs since it requires lower dependence on chemical fertilizers than a sole cropping system. In this study, we compared the effects of sole cropping and intercropping on early bolting, yield, and the chemical composition of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels. Field experiments were conducted, in 2018 and in 2019, using different cropping systems including sole cropping of A. sinensis (AS), sole cropping of Vicia faba (VF), and intercropping (without fertilization) at three ratios: one row of A. sinensis + three rows of V. faba, AS/VF (1:3), two rows of A. sinensis + two rows V. faba, AS/VF (2:2), three rows of A. sinensis + one row V. faba, AS/VF (3:1). The effect of each cropping system was evaluated by measuring the dry biomass of V. faba and the dry biomass, ferulic acid content, and essential oil content and composition of A. sinensis. The early bolting rate of A. sinensis was significantly lower in the intercropping system as compared with that in a sole cropping system. The AS/VF (3:1) intercropping pattern resulted in an optimal yield and the highest ferulic acid content of A. sinensis, highest dry biomass of V. faba, and highest land equivalent ratio (LER). Additionally, the A. sinensis was more aggressive (the aggressivity value of A. sinensis was positive, and its competitive ratio was >1) under AS/VF (3:1) intercropping pattern, and it dominated over V. faba (which had negative aggressivity values and a competitive ratio of <1) under AS/VF (3:1) intercropping pattern. Ligustilide was the most dominant component of the essential oil of A. sinensis, regardless of the cropping system; however, the chemical component of essential oil was not influenced by intercropping patterns. Overall, the AS/VF (3:1) intercropping pattern without fertilization was the most productive, with the highest LER and ferulic acid content. These data indicate that intercropping can serve as an alternative for reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and intercropping also decreases the early bolting rate of A. sinensis, thus, enabling its sustainable production.",

            "content": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR), in which inflammation has been implicated playing important roles, is one of the most common diabetes complications. Dang Gui Bu Xue Tang (DBT), an aqueous extract of Radix Astragali and Radix Angelica sinensis, is a classical prescription in Traditional Chinese Medicine for treating inflammation and ischemic diseases. Here, we investigated the effects of a modified recipe of DBT, with addition of Panax notoginseng, in treating diabetic retinopathy. An aqueous extract of Radix Astragali, Radix Angelica sinensis, and Panax notoginseng (RRP) was given to Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats and streptozotocin-induced Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Leukostasis, vascular leakage, and acellular capillaries in retinal vasculature of animals were determined. Expression of retinal inflammatory biomarkers was assessed. We found that RRP reduced leukostasis, acellular capillaries, and vascular leakage compared to diabetic control rats. We also found that RRP decreased the expression of inflammatory factors including IL-1 β , IL-6, TNF- α , NF- κ B, MCP-1, ICAM-1, or VCAM-1 in the retinas of GK rats and reversed high glucose-induced inhibition of endothelial cell migration and proliferation in vitro. We conclude that RRP has a potent effect in preventing the pathogenesis and/or progression of DR and thus may serve as a promising nontoxic therapeutic approach of DR.",

It is important to trace the origin and confirm the regional characteristics of medicinal products for sustainable industrial development. Effectively tracing and confirming the material's origin may be accomplished by detecting stable isotopes and mineral elements.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      We studied 25 A. sinensis samples collected from three main producing areas (Linxia, Gannan, and Dingxi) in southeastern Gansu Province, China, to better identify its origin. We used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) to determine eight mineral elements (K, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cu, Mn, Cr, Al) and three stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N, δ18O). Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to verify the validity of its geographical origin.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      K, Ca/Al, δ13C, δ15N and δ18O are important elements to distinguish A. sinensis sampled from Linxia, Gannan and Dingxi. We used an unsupervised PCA model to determine the dimensionality reduction of mineral elements and stable isotopes, which could distinguish the A. sinensis from Linxia. However, it could not easily distinguish A. sinensis sampled from Gannan and Dingxi. The supervised PLS-DA and LDA models could effectively distinguish samples taken from all three regions and perform cross-validation. The cross-validation accuracy of PLS-DA using mineral elements and stable isotopes was 84%, which was higher than LDA using mineral elements and stable isotopes.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The PLS-DA and LDA models provide a theoretical basis for tracing the origin of A. sinensis in three regions (Linxia, Gannan and Dingxi). This is significant for protecting consumers' health, rights and interests.",

            "content": "Background:Dang gui (Apiaceae; Angelica sinensis radix) is among the most often used Chinese medicinal plants. However, hardly anything is known about its value chain and its influence on the main marker compounds of the drug. The aim of this study is to investigate the value chain of dang gui in Gansu and Yunnan, and the analysis of the marker compounds ferulic acid and Z-ligustilide concentration in relation to quality criteria such as the production area and size of the roots. Methods: During six months of field research in China, semi-structured interviews with various stakeholders of the value chain were undertaken and plant material was collected. High-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) was used for semi-quantitative analysis of ferulic acid and Z-ligustilide. Results: Small-scale household cultivation prevails and in Gansu-in contrast to Yunnan-the cultivation of dang gui is often the main income source of farmers. Farmers and dealers use size and odor of the root as main quality criteria. For Chinese medicine doctors, Gansu as the production area is the main criterion. Higher amounts of ferulic acid in plant material from Yunnan compared to Gansu were found. Additionally, a negative relation of root length with both ferulic acid and Z-ligustilide as well as head diameter with ferulic acid were found. Conclusions: HPTLC is a valid method for semi-quantitative analysis of the marker compounds of dang gui. However, the two main marker compounds cannot explain why size and smell of the root or production area are seen as quality criteria. This hints at the inherent difficulty to correlate quality notions of medicinal plants with specific chemical compounds. With respect to this, more attention should be paid to quality in terms of cultivation and processing techniques.",

            "content": "We studied the protective effects of polysaccharides isolated from the root of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) (Danggui) on gastrointestinal damage induced by ethanol or indomethacin in rats. Oral administration of ethanol provoked a marked hemorrhagic damage in the glandular mucosa, which was accompanied with a significant increase of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, a marker enzyme for inflammation and neutrophil infiltration. An extract from Angelica, which mainly consisted of polysaccharides (95%) (AP), dose-dependently prevented gastric mucosal damage. This ulcer protective effect could last at least 12 h after administration. Prostaglandin E2 produced a similar anti-lesion effect. AP and prostaglandin E2 also reduced mucosal MPO activity. Indomethacin-induced gastrointestinal damage, another neutrophil-dependent lesion model in the gastrointestinal tract, was also prevented by AP pretreatment. The present findings suggest that polysaccharides from Angelica possess an anti-inflammatory action, perhaps through the inhibitory action on neutrophil infiltration in the gastrointestinal mucosa. AP could potentially be useful to prevent any neutrophil-dependent mucosal injury in the gastrointestinal tract.",

            "content": "The root of the perennial herb Angelica sinensis is a widely used source for traditional Chinese medicines. While the plant thrives in cool-moist regions of western China, early bolting and flowering (EBF) for young plants significantly reduces root quality and yield. Approaches to inhibit EBF by changes in physiology during the vernalization process have been investigated; however, the mechanism for activating EBF is still limited. Here, transcript profiles for bolted and unbolted plants (BP and UBP, respectively) were compared by transcriptomic analysis, expression levels of candidate genes were validated by qRT-PCR, and the accumulations of gibberellins (GA1, GA4, GA8, GA9 and GA20) were also monitored by HPLC-MS/MS. A total of over 72,000 unigenes were detected with ca. 2600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) observed in the BP compared with UBP. While various signaling pathways participate in flower induction, it is genes associated with floral development and the sucrose pathway that are observed to be coordinated in EBF plants, coherently up- and down-regulating flowering genes that activate and inhibit flowering, respectively. The signature transcripts pattern for the developmental pathways that drive flowering provides insight into the molecular signals that activate plant EBF.",

            "content": "In this study, we explored the adaptive mechanism of two varieties of Angelica sinensis exposed to enhanced Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation. The radiation had different effects on the biomass, photosynthetic performance, oxidative damage, antioxidant defense system, and levels of bioactive compounds of Mingui 1 (C1) and Mingui 2 (C2). C2 outperformed C1 under enhanced UV-B radiation, compared to natural light. Using the Illumina RNA-seq, we obtained 6,326 and 2,583 DEGs in C1 and C2, respectively. Under enhanced UV-B radiation, the mRNA levels of genes involved in photosynthesis, antennae protein synthesis, carbon fixation, chlorophyll synthesis, and carotenoid synthesis were decreased in C1 but stable in C2, involving few DEGs. TFs were widely involved in the response of C1 to enhanced UV-B radiation; almost all bHLH and MYB coding genes were downregulated whereas almost all genes encoded WRKY22, WRKY50, WRKY72, NCF, and HSF were upregulated. These results indicate that enhanced UV-B radiation was not conducive to the synthesis of flavonoids, while disease resistance was enhanced. Regarding the ROS scavenging system, upregulated DEGs were mainly found in the AsA-GSH cycle and PrxR/Trx pathways. Remarkably, DEGs that those encoding biosynthetic key enzymes, including ferulic acid (CHS, CHI, DFR, and ANS) and flavonoid (CHS, CHI, DFR, and ANS), most upregulation in C2, leading to increased accumulation of ferulic acid and flavonoids and adversely affecting C1. Genes encoding key enzymes involved in the synthesis of lactone components (ACX, PXG) were mostly up-regulated in C1, increasing the content of lactone components. Our results reveal the DEGs present between C1 and C2 under enhanced UV-B radiation and are consistent with the observed differences in physiological and biochemical indexes. C1 was more sensitive to enhanced UV-B radiation, and C2 was more tolerant to it under moderate enhanced UV-B radiation stress. In addition, the large amount of A. sinensis transcriptome data generated here will serve as a source for finding effective ways to mitigate UV-B enhancement, and also contribute to the well-established lack of genetic information for non-model plant species.",

            "content": "Angelica sinensis is a low-temperature and long-day perennial herb that has been widely used for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases in recent years. In commercial cultivation, up to 40% of flowering decreases the officinal yield of roots and accumulation of bioactive compounds. Although the regulatory mechanism of flowering genes during the photoperiod has been revealed, the networks during vernalization have not been mapped. Here, transcriptomics profiles of A. sinensis with uncompleted (T1), completed (T2) and avoided vernalization (T3) were performed using RNA-seq, and genes expression was validated with qRT-PCR. A total of 61,241 isoforms were annotated on KEGG, KOG, Nr and Swiss-Prot databases; 4212 and 5301 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed; and 151 and 155 genes involved in flowering were dug out at T2 vs. T1 and T3 vs. T1, respectively. According to functional annotation, 104 co-expressed genes were classified into six categories: FLC expression (22; e.g., VILs, FCA and FLK), sucrose metabolism (12; e.g., TPSs, SUS3 and SPSs), hormone response (18; e.g., GID1B, RAP2s and IAAs), circadian clock (2; i.e., ELF3 and COR27), downstream floral integrators and meristem identity (15; e.g., SOC1, AGL65 and SPLs) and cold response (35; e.g., PYLs, ERFs and CORs). The expression levels of candidate genes were almost consistent with FPKM values and changes in sugar and hormone contents. Based on their functions, four pathways that regulate flowering during vernalization were mapped, including the vernalization pathway, the autonomic pathway, the age pathway and the GA (hormone) pathway. This transcriptomic analysis provides new insights into the gene-regulatory networks of flowering in A. sinensis.",

ASP treatment prevents HSC/HPCs senescence with decreased AGEs levels in the serum, reduced SA-β-Gal positive cells, and promoted CFU-Mix formation in the D-gal administrated mouse. We further found that multiple mechanisms were involved: (1) ASP treatment prevented oxidative damage as total antioxidant capacity was increased and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 8-OHdG, and 4-HNE were declined, (2) ASP reduced the expression of γ-H2A.X which is a DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) marker and decreased the subsequent ectopic expressions of effectors in p16Ink4a-RB and p19Arf-p21Cip1/Waf senescent pathways, and (3) ASP inhibited the excessive activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in aged HSC/HPCs, as the expressions of β-catenin, phospho-GSK-3β, and TCF-4 were decreased, and the cyto-nuclear translocation of β-catenin was inhibited. Moreover, compared with the positive control of Vitamin E, ASP exhibited a better antiaging effect and a weaker antioxidation ability, suggesting a novel protective role of ASP in the hematopoietic system.",

DangGui (Angelica sinensis) is mentioned to show renal protective effect in combination with other herbs. Bone morphogenetic proteins-7 (BMP-7) is produced merit in protection of DN. The role of BMP-7 in DangGui-induced renal improvement is not clear. The present study investigated the effects of DangGui on renal functions, BMP-7 expression and the levels of ROS in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and high glucose-exposed rat mesangial cells (RMCs). After 1- or 4-week treatment, DangGui improved renal functions and increased renal BMP-7 expression in diabetic rats. The BMP-7 expression in RMCs was reduced by high glucose treatment and this could be reversed by DangGui. Moreover, RMCs exposed to high glucose were expired by BMP-7 RNAi transfection but those cells remained alive by scramble transfection. Thus, we employed regular RMCs to knock down BMP-7 with RNAi and we found that DangGui increased BMP-7 expression in these RMCs. Direct activation of BMP-7 expression by DangGui could be considered. The results of DPPH assay, DHE stain and lucigenin assay indicated that DangGui could inhibit high glucose-induced ROS in RMCs. These results suggest that DangGui has an ability to improve renal functions in STZ-diabetic rats through increasing endogenous BMP-7 expression and decreasing oxidative stress in kidney. The present study suggest that DangGui could be applied to improve renal functions in diabetic disorders.",

Adding 0.3% agar to the liquid medium also stimulated the formation of somatic and germinating embryos. While no plant growth regulators were needed for culture initiation and plant regeneration, the addition of 0.5-1 mg/l 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid was needed to maintain the embryogenic suspension culture by preventing embryo germination. Forty percent of the germinating embryos survived after culturing on filter paper moistened with liquid half-strength MS medium containing 3% sucrose. The plants were successfully transferred into soil.",

            "content": "Background: Angelica sinensis is a medicinal plant known for a variety of biological effects, including its ability to stimulate innate immune cells in humans. Recent studies indicate that the immunostimulatory activity of A. sinensis arises from microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) of plant-associated bacteria. However, it is unknown which bacterial taxa in A. sinensis are responsible for the production of immunostimulatory MAMPs. Methods: Samples of A. sinensis were subjected to a cell-based assay to detect monocyte-stimulation and 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing, which revealed their immunostimulatory activity and microbial communities. The resulting data were analyzed by Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), an online biostatistical tool for metagenomic biomarker discovery, to identify the bacterial taxonomical features correlated with the immunostimulatory activity. Results: A series of bacterial taxa under Gammaproteobacteria correlated positively with the immunostimulatory activity, whereas several Gram-positive taxa and Betaproteobacteria correlated negatively with the activity. Conclusions: The identified bacterial taxa set a new stage to characterize immunostimulatory MAMPs in plants.",

            "content": "Currently, the polluted wastewater discharged by industry accounts for the major part of polluted bodies of water. As one of the industrial wastewaters, dye wastewater is characterized by high toxicity, wide pollution, and difficulty in decolorization degradation. In this paper, a novel composite nanomaterial catalyst of silver was prepared by using Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) as a reducing and stabilizing agent. And the optimum reaction conditions explored are VAgNO3 = 5 mL (300 mM) and vASP = 7% (w/v) for 6 h at 90 °C. In addition, the ASP-Ag nanocatalyst was characterized by several techniques. The results demonstrated that ASP-Ag nanoparticles were successfully synthesized. Degradation rate, which provides a numerical visualization of the percentage reduction in pollutant concentration. With the wrapping of ASP, the ultrasonic catalytic degradation rates of different organic dyes including rhodamine B (RB), methylene blue (MB), and methyl orange (MO) were from 88.2%, 88.7%, and 85.2% to 96.1%, 95.2% and 93.5% at room temperature, respectively. After the experiments, when cdyes = 10 mg/L, the highest degradation rate can be observed under cAPS-AgNPs = 10 mg/L with the most powerful cavitation frequency f = 59 kHz. The effect of ultrasonic frequency on the acoustic pressure distribution in the reactor was investigated by using COMSOL Multiphysis@ software to propose the mechanism of ultrasonic degradation and the mechanism was confirmed by OH radical trapping experiments. It indicates that OH produced by the ultrasonic cavitation effect plays a determinant role in the degradation. And then, the intermediate products of the dye degradation process were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the possible degradation processes of dyes were proposed. The resulting products of degradation are SO42-, NH4+, NO3-, N2, CO2 and H2O. Finally, the recycling degradation experiments showed that catalyst maintains a high degradation rate within reusing 5 cycles. Thus, this catalyst is highly efficient and recyclable.",

            "content": "Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels is a perennial herb of the genus Angelica in the family Umbelliferae. The dried root of A. sinensis has have long been used medicinally (Zhang et al., 2016). Several plant viruses have been reported to infect A. sinensis: tomato mosaic virus, Japanese hornwort mosaic virus, and konjak mosaic virus (Zhang et al., 2020). In July 2019, we collected A. sinensis samples exhibiting symptoms of yellowing, mottling, and wrinkling from fields in Gansu Province. Seven plants were mixed in a composite sample and were commissioned to Biotech Bioengineering (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. for small RNA sequencing. Total RNA of A. sinensis was extracted according to the manufacturer's directions using the total RNA extraction kit (Tiangen Biochemical Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd.). The library was constructed using the TruSeq™ Small RNA Sample Prep Kits (Illumina, San Diego, USA) kit and was sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq2000/2500 with a single-end read length of 1X50bp. Samples were sequenced to obtain 1199561625 raw reads and 281093971 clean reads by removing low quality reads. Quality-controlled qualified reads were assembled using SPAdes (Bankevich et al., 2012) with a k-mer value of 17 and the obtained results were compared with NCBI's nucleotide database. Eight contigs were annotated as homologous to apple latent spherical virus (ALSV, AB030940.1 and AB030941.1). The similarity between the eight contigs and the reference genome ranged from 84% to 90%. The sequencing coverage of RNA1 and RNA2 of ALSV were 23.00% and 32.36%, respectively.The specific primers F 5`-CAGGGCCCAGATTTCACTAGAATTA-3` and R 5`- CTAAGTGTAGCCAGCCTTGAGCAATC -3` were designed based on acquired contigs to validate the sequencing results in the individual samples. One of the original composite samples was ALSV positive. Polymerase chain reaction products were detected in 1.5% agarose geland 1761 bp target band was obtained. The obtained sequence (OP038546) was searched against the NCBI nucleotide database using the BLASTn algorithm. Results showed that it shared 81.53% nucleotide sequence identities with the genome of ALSV ((AB030941.1) and this is the first time that ALSV was found to naturally infect A. sinensis. ALSV belongs to the genus Cheravirus in the family Secoviridae that was first identified in apple leaves (Li et al., 2000). To analyze the phylogenetic relationships of ALSV, all the coat protein genes of genus Cheravirus were downloaded from NCBI and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Construct/Test Maximum Likelihood Tree method using MEGA7.0 software. The self-extension value was 1000, and the branches with evolutionary numbers below 50% were removed. The ALSV isolate obtained from Gansu A. sinensis in this experiment aggregated in the same branch as the ALSV infested apple, again proving that the virus is ALSV (Fig.1A). Additionally, a total of 111 A. sinensis samples were collected and validated by RT-PCR with primers ALSV-F and ALSV-R. Among these samples, 15 were positive for ALSV. The overall infection rate of ALSV on A. sinensis was 13.51%. The detection rates of Weiyuan, Zhangxian, Tanchang, Minxian and Yuzhong were 15.38%, 40.00%, 23.08%, 7.84% and 8.33%, respectively (Table.1). A. sinensis infested with ALSV may produce symptoms of chlorotic and mottle (Fig.1C and D), which is similar to that in quinoa. Accordingly, larger scale A. sinensis investigations must be conducted to determine the distribution and prevalence of ALSV in China.",

            "content": "Vascular endothelial dysfunction is an essential and early sign of diabetic macroangiopathy, a primary complication of diabetes mellitus. Astragalus membranaceous-Angelica sinensis is a classic medical combination applied in China to treat diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the granule form of the extract produced from the dried root of Astragalus membranaceous (AM) combination with the granule form of the extract produced from the dried Angelica sinensis (AS) on diabetic macroangiopathy and its underlying mechanism. Herein, rats were treated by AM-AS at a ratio of 3 : 2 via intragastric administration. High glucose-induced human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were then treated with drug-containing serum collected from the rats. In high glucose-treated HUVECs, AM-AS combination increased cell viability (P < 0.05), decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells (P < 0.05) and the expression of the proapoptosis protein caspase 3 (P < 0.05), reduced the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase (P < 0.05), decreased reactive oxygen species level (P < 0.05), enhanced cell migration and invasion (P < 0.05), and reduced the level of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha. These results indicate that AM-AS combination at the ratio of 3 : 2 ameliorated HUVEC dysfunction by regulating apoptosis, cell migration, and invasion, which might be mediated by their regulatory effect on reactive oxygen species production. The current study provides a theoretical basis for the treatment of diabetic macroangiopathy using AM-AS.",

            "content": "Aims: This review aims to compare the use of herbal medicine used to treat women's menstruation and the prevalence of menstrual diseases in different regions, which reveal the use of herbal medicine globally and provide scientific guidance for improving women's health. Materials and Methods: The information available on herbal medicines for women between the years 2000 and 2021 was systematically collected via the library and electronic search systems such as Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science as well as secondary resources including books and conference proceedings. Results: Totally, 571 ethnic medicines commonly used for women's menstruation health in Asia, Europe, Oceania, Africa, and America were accounted. Zingiber officinale Roscoe (Ginger), Ruta graveolens L. (Common rue), Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (Angelica sinensis), Foeniculum vulgare Mill (Fennel), Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don (Catharanthus roseus) and other medicines which have obvious advantages and long-term usage are utilized in the treatment of menstrual diseases. Family Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, Apiaceae, Fabaceae, and Zingiberaceae are the most common medicinal plant families used for such treatments. In many instances, the application of fresh parts of plants was observed because of the healers' belief regarding the higher efficiency of the medicine made from fresh plants. Edible plants are used in a wide range of countries. Conclusion: Women's menstruation health is directly related to their health condition. Traditional medicines of most ethnic groups have contributed to women's health care and treatment of gynecological diseases. Practitioners in this field have gained elaborate experience in treatments and medication, and assembled a large number of effective drugs and prescriptions. These experiences have also been inherited and developed by modern clinical application and scientific research. However, the basic research on these drugs is not sufficient, the knowledge of drug use has not been fully popularized, the advantages of drugs have not been fully utilized, and the guiding potential to modern drug research continues to be insufficient. As such, it is necessary to further promote and make a significant contribution to women's health.",

            "content": "A polysaccharides-enriched fraction from the root of Angelica sinensis, which is known for its antiulcer action on the gastrointestinal tract, was isolated and studied for its hepato-protective effect in rodents. Intra-gastric administration of Angelica sinensis polysaccharides-enriched fraction (AP) at the doses of 50 or 75 mg/kg dose-dependently prevented liver toxicity induced by acetaminophen in mice but did not affect the serum acetaminophen concentration. It normalized the rises of serum alanine transferase (ALT) and hepatic nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities and the decrease of glutathione level in the liver. It also reduced the hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. The protective effect was less evident in the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-treated animals including mice and rats. In the rat the elevated serum ALT level was unaffected though the MDA level was similarly reduced by the higher dose of AP. In these animals, CCl4 increased the hepatic glutathione level instead while the NOS activity remained unchanged. These findings suggest that the pathogenic mechanisms of both acetaminophen and CCl4 are different. AP is more effective in the protection against liver damage induced by acetaminophen, which is associated with the glutathione depletion and nitric oxide synthase activation in the liver.",

Since safety studies of herbs would be unethical to carry out in patients, the present study aimed to investigate the potential unsafe effects of AS in a systematic pre-clinical approach. Human breast cancer cells, breast orthotopic tumor-bearing mouse models, as well as primary breast cancer cells from patients' tumors were used to evaluate the effect of AS hot water extract on the progression of breast tumors and/or growth of breast cancer cells. We showed that AS is not that stimulatory in breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo, though AS should still be used with caution in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients. This novel approach of applying breast cancer cell lines, xenograft, and syngeneic tumors models, as well as primary breast cancer cells from patients' tumors in Chinese medicines safety evaluation was proven feasible. Our finding is important information for patients, Chinese medicine practitioners, and clinicians on the safety use of AS in breast cancer, which will affect future clinical practice.",

This paper aimed to explore the role of ASP on proliferation and differentiation of rat BMSCs. Rat BMSCs were subjected to isolation and identification through flow cytometry. The proliferation of rat BMSCs under ASP was performed by CCK-8 kit. Measures of osteogenesis under different concentrations of ASP were detected by using alizarin red staining for mesenchymal cells differentiation and ALP activity assay to identify ALP activity. Quantitative RT-PCR was selected to identify osteoblastic or adipogenic biomarkers from a genetic perspective. Likewise, we have evaluated measures of indicators of Wnt/β-catenin signal. ASP significantly promoted the proliferation, increased osteogenesis, and decreased adipogenesis of rat BMSCs within the limit of 20-60 mg/L in a dose-dependent manner but was suppressed at 80 mg/L. The expression of cyclin D1 and ß-catenin showed a considerable rise over the course of ASP induced osteogenesis. Dickkopf 1 (DKK1) suppressed the regulation of rat BMSCs differentiation through the mediation of ASP. We have observed that ASP upregulated the osteogenic but downregulated adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs, and our findings help to contribute to effective solutions for treating bone disorders.",

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that ASCE has a direct stimulating effect on gastric epithelial cells for wound healing. We found that ASCE significantly promoted the migration of epithelial cells over an artificial wound on the surface of an RGM-1 monolayer. The extract also stimulated DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner and concomitantly increased EGF mRNA expression. Co-incubation of ASCE with anti-EGF antibody reduced the speed of migration and the DNA synthesis, which however were still higher than the control without ASCE. These results strongly suggest that ASCE has a direct wound healing effect on gastric mucosa, and this is acting partially through an EGF-mediated pathway.",

The rats were then allocated to 4 groups at random: Model group, and L group, 4.2 g/kg, M group, 8.4 g/kg and H group, 16.8 g/kg. In addition, the group of normal feeding with unlimited diet was set as N group. Blood samples were taken to detect the relevant physiological and biochemical indexes. For organ coefficient analysis, 10 kinds of organ tissues were dissected and weighed. The tonifying effect of DAZM was discussed according to the BDI-GS system.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      During the modeling, the weight of rats in the normal group displayed a marked growth trend, and the weight of the model group was markedly lower than that of the normal group. After feeding the rats DAZM at a low, intermediate, and high dose, the anal temperature of rats in each group continued to rise, and finally remained basically the same as that of normal rats. Hematological and urine examinations revealed that the urea nitrogen and creatinine (CRE) of the model group and the experimental group were markedly higher than those of the normal group, and there were marked differences. After intragastric administration of DAZM, E2 increased markedly. The BDI-GS values of the liver, spleen, lung, kidney, brain, ovary, and adrenal gland of female rats in the 3 administration groups of DAZM were >1, and the total cumulative GS value of each organ of female rats was more than 10.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The decoction of DAZM has no obvious effect on the growth, metabolism, and development of female rats with SKYD, causes no obvious damage to organs, and has a certain reparative effect on the kidney damage caused by SKYD.",

            "content": "Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, a traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely prescribed in treatment of gynecological diseases. Bio-based assays for extracts of Angelica sinensis showed that the acetone extract (AE-AS) had dose-dependently antiproliferative effect on A549, HT29, DBTRG-05MG and J5 human cancer cells. The IC50 values of AE-AS on mentioned cancer cells ranged from 35 to 50 microg/ml after 24 h of treatment. After 72 h of exposure, AE-AS (40 microg/ml) significantly reduced A549 cell proliferation to 24 +/- 3.2% of control. In A549 cells, the cell cycle analysis showed that AE-AS induced a significant increase in the number of cells in G0/G1, with a concomitant decrease in the number of cells in S phase. AE-AS-induced chromatin changes and apoptosis of A549 cells were confirmed by Hoechst 33342 DNA staining and annexin V staining. A549 cells treated with AE-AS caused activation of caspase-9 and -3, and AE-AS-induced apoptosis could be inhibited by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk. The Western blot indicated the AE-AS-triggered apoptosis is mediated via suppression of Bcl-2 oncoprotein expression rather than p53 or Bax. Besides, AE-AS decreased the levels of cdk4 protein was observed. These results indicate that the AE-AS could induce G1/S arrest and activate the mechanism of apoptosis in human cancer cells. Extracts obtained from different methods of fractionation might possess distinct bioactivity. These results prompted us to further evaluate the in vivo anticancer effects and elucidate the chemical composition profile of AE-AS.",

Different extracts of Angelica sinensis (AS) and one of its active compounds, ferulic acid (FA), were used to evaluate the therapeutic effects in a MN mouse model. The MN model was grouped into three subgroups: no treatment (N-T), treatment at induction of MN (Pre-T), and treatment after full-blown MN (Post-T). The results showed that the methanol (ME) layer of AS extract exhibited a therapeutic effect on MN-induced proteinuria. The ME layer-enriched compound, FA, improved the hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and proteinuria in both Pre-T and Post-T groups. Ferulic acid also reduced the formation of oxidative protein products and increased the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes in groups Pre-T and Post-T. Regarding angiogenesis factors, the antiangiogenic factors in renal glomeruli were increased in group N-T, but, after FA treatment, only one of the antiangiogenic factors, thrombospondin-1, showed a significant decrease. Furthermore, the expression of Th2 predominant showed significant decrease in both Pre-T and Post-T groups when compared to that of N-T group. In summary, FA retarded the progression of MN, and the mechanisms involved the regulation of oxidative stresses, angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, and attenuation of Th2 response.",

It is not known whether AP has an effect on CY-induced cytotoxicity on bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we assessed the protective actions of AP on CY-induced leukopenia and proliferative arrest in the gastroduodenal mucosa in mice. Subcutaneous injection of CY (200 mg/kg) provoked dramatic decrease in white blood cell (WBC) count and number of blood vessels and proliferating cells in both the gastric and duodenal mucosae. Subcutaneous injection of AP significantly promoted the recovery from leukopenia and increased number of blood vessels and proliferating cells in both the gastric and duodenal tissues. Western blotting revealed that CY significantly down-regulated the protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), c-Myc and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in gastric mucosae but had no effect on epidermal growth factor (EGF) expression. AP also reversed the dampening effect of CY on VEGF expression in the gastric mucosa. These data suggest that AP is a cytoprotective agent which can protect against the cytotoxicity of CY on hematopoietic and gastrointestinal tissues when the polysaccharide is co-administered with CY in cancer patients during treatment regimen.",

            "content": "This study aimed to investigate the effect of Angelica sinensis polysaccharides (ASP) on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its underlying mechanisms. In our study, we build the AD model by injecting Aβ25–35. Morris water maze (MWM) was applied to investigate learning and memory. Moreover, neurotransmitters, free radical, and inflammatory factors were also measured. Pathological change and neuronal death in hippocampus CA1, CA3, and DG region were detected by HE staining and Nissl staining. The neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL. The expressions of caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax were measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The expressions of BDNF, TrkB, p-Akt, Akt, p-CREB, and CREB were measured by Western blot. Our results showed that ASP could ameliorate spatial learning and memory deficiency in AD rats. ASP decreased AchE level and increased the levels of Ach and chAT in AD rats. ASP could increase the activity of SOD and CAT, decrease MDA activity, and inhibit the expression levels of inflammatory factors and neurons apoptosis in AD rats. Pathological change of hippocampus CA1, CA3, and DG region was ameliorated by ASP. In addition, the effects of ASP were reversed by K252a (TrkB inhibitor). Our study demonstrated that ASP could ameliorate memory impairment in AD rat through activating BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway.,Impact statement:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The present study demonstrated that ASP could ameliorate memory impairment through regulation of the balance of neurotransmitters, free radical metabolism, inflammation, and neurons apoptosis. Moreover, the mechanism of ASP on memory impairment may be related to BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway in AD. Our research provides an innovatively regulatory mechanism about the ASP in AD rat and points a new way to the treatment of AD.",

Therefore, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was developed for the simultaneous determination of 13 organic components (8 phthalides and 5 phenolic acids), and 8 inorganic elements were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The contents of 32 samples were analyzed by orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, and least-significant difference of one-way analysis of variance.

APS-3c was administrated into rat OA knee joints and had protective effects on rat OA cartilage in vivo. Primary rat articular chondrocytes were cotreated with APS-3c and IL-1 β in vitro. 2~50 μ g/mL APS-3c had no effect on chondrocytes viability, whereas it increased the proteoglycans (PGs) synthesis inhibited by IL-1 β . Microarray analysis showed that the significant changes were concentrated in the genes which were involved in PGs synthesis. RT-PCR confirmed that treatment with APS-3c increased the mRNA expression of aggrecan and glycosyltransferases (GTs) inhibited by IL-1 β but did not affect the mRNA expression of matrix-degrading enzymes. These results indicate that APS-3c can improve PGs synthesis of chondrocytes on rat OA model in vivo and IL-1 β -stimulated chondrocytes in vitro, which is due to the promotion of the expression of aggrecan and GTs involved in PGs synthesis but not the inhibition of the expression of matrix-degrading enzymes. Our findings suggest the clinical relevance of APS-3c in the prospective of future alternative medical treatment for OA.",

            "content": "The present study is focused on the development of an analytical method for the simultaneous analysis of seventy-four pesticides belonging to different chemical classes (organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids, dinitroanilines, dicarboximides, triazoles, etc.) in Chinese material medica. The samples were extracted according to the acetate QuEChERS protocol. To reduce the amount of co-extracted compounds, n-hexane instead of acetonitrile was employed as the extraction solvent. To improve the overall recoveries of problematic basic and base-sensitive compounds, sodium acetate was used to adjust the pH to a neutral condition, and florisil combined with octadecyl-modified silica (C18) were utilized in the cleanup step. The samples were analysed by GC-MS/MS, and quantified by matrix-matched calibration. The validation study was carried out on two representative herbs, Chuanxiong Rhizoma and Angelica Sinensis Radix. In two matrices, the linearity of the calibration was good between 5 and 250 ng/mL concentration ranges, and the limits of quantification (LOQs) less than 0.01 mg/kg for most pesticides. At the LOQs and ten times the LOQs, the mean recoveries of almost all pesticides were within 70-120%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 10%. The method was applied on twenty real samples. Seven batches of Chuanxiong and five batches of Danggui were found to contain the residues. The combination of modified QuEChERS and GC-MS/MS offers low cost of analysis as well as excellent accuracy and sensitivity. This method could be especially useful for trace analysis of pesticide residues in complex matrices.",

Under the selected optimum conditions, the six monosaccharides could be perfectly separated within 25 min and showed significant current responses at copper electrodes. The linear ranges of the six monosaccharides were all from 5.0 x 10(-6) to 2.0 x 10(-4) mol L(-1) and their detection limits were lower or near 1.0 x 10(-6) mol L(-1) (S/N = 3). Experiments showed that the Angelica sinensis polysaccharide was composed of fucose, galactose, glucose, arabinose, rhamnose and xylose (mole ratio 1.0:13.6:15.0:8.7:21.3:3.7), and the flax polysaccharide was composed of galactose, glucose and arabinose (mole ratio 1.0:4.98:1.1). The purity of these polysaccharides leached by the introduced leaching method was 98.3 and 97.6%, respectively. Analyzing polysaccharides by this method has some merits of speed, simple instrumentation and operation, high sensitivity and high reproducibility.",

            "content": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly vascularized and invasive neoplasm. The methanol extract of Angelica sinensis (AS-M) is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat several diseases, such as gastric mucosal damage, hepatic injury, menopausal symptoms, and chronic glomerulonephritis. AS-M also displays potency in suppressing the growth of malignant brain tumor cells. The growth suppression of malignant brain tumor cells by AS-M results from cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. AS-M upregulates expression of cyclin kinase inhibitors, including p16, to decrease the phosphorylation of Rb proteins, resulting in arrest at the G0-G1 phase. The expression of the p53 protein is increased by AS-M and correlates with activation of apoptosis-associated proteins. Therefore, the apoptosis of cancer cells induced by AS-M may be triggered through the p53 pathway. In in vivo studies, AS-M not only suppresses the growth of human malignant brain tumors but also significantly prolongs patient survival. In addition, AS-M has potent anticancer effects involving cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and antiangiogenesis. The in vitro and in vivo anticancer effects of AS-M indicate that this extract warrants further investigation and potential development as a new antibrain tumor agent, providing new hope for the chemotherapy of malignant brain cancer.",

As a result, it was found that SA is a characteristic standard compound for the quality evaluation and chemical differentiation between CX and DG. Methanol was chosen in the preparation of standard solutions and extraction of samples based on the stability data. The identity of SA in CX and DG was unambiguously determined based on the quasimolecular ions in ESI-MS. A comprehensive validation of the method, including sensitivity, linearity, reproducibility and recovery, was conducted using the optimized chromatographic conditions. The linear calibration curve was acquired with R2>0.999 and limit of detection (S/N=3) was estimated to be 12.5 mug/g. The reproducibility was evaluated by repeated sample injection and replicated analysis of samples with the relative standard deviation (RSD) value found within 0.68%. The recovery rates of SA varied within the range of 96.91-101.50% with RSD less than 2.38%. In the present work, the contents of SA were quantified within 3.94-9.14 mg/g and 0.108-0.588 mg/g for 12 batches each of CX and DG. The results demonstrated that SA is a useful standard compound for the quality evaluation and chemical differentiation between CX and DG.

Besides its traditional use as the blood-nourishing tonic, its anti-hypertensive, anti-cardiovascular, neuroprotective and anti-cancer effects have been reported. Albeit the significant therapeutic effects, how AS exerts such diverse efficacies from the molecular level remains elusive. Here we investigate the influences of AS and four representative phthalide derivatives from AS on the structure and function of hemoglobin (Hb). From the spectroscopy and oxygen equilibrium experiments, we show that AS and the chosen phthalides inhibited the oxygenated Hb from transforming into the high-affinity \"relaxed\" (R) state, decreasing Hb's oxygen affinity. It reveals that phthalides cooperate with the endogenous Hb modulator, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) to synergetically regulate Hb allostery. From the docking modeling, phthalides appear to interact with Hb mainly through its α1/α2 interface, likely strengthening four (out of six) Hb \"tense\" (T) state stabilizing salt-bridges. A new allosteric-modulating mechanism is proposed to rationalize the capacity of phthalides to facilitate Hb oxygen transport, which may be inherently correlated with the therapeutic activities of AS. The potential of phthalides to serve as 2,3-BPG substitutes/supplements and their implications in the systemic biology and preventive medicine are discussed.",

RAS extract (1 g/kg) significantly prolonged the shortened step-through latency induced by SCOP and CXM, but not PCA. Furthermore, RAS(H) fraction (1 g/kg) also significantly prolonged the shortened step-through latency induced by SCOP and CXM but not PCA. RAS extract at any dose alone did not influence the step-through latency in the training trial produced by non-shocked rats, but it plus PCA prolonged the latency compared with PCA alone. However, RAS(H) fraction (1 g/kg) prolonged the latency in the training trial produced by non-shocked rats, but it plus any induced drugs did not differ from any induced drugs alone. These results suggest that the attenuating effects of RAS extract on the various drugs-induced amnesia were related to the memory processes. n-Hexane fraction of RAS extract might be one of the active fractions of RAS extract in the treatment of amnesia.",

Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is one of the most important active ingredients isolated from Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort; ferulic acid (FA) is the main water-soluble component of Angelica sinensis. 2. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible effect of FA on the brain pharmacokinetics of TMP in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats. The pharmacokinetic parameters of TMP were investigated in brain microdialysates after oral and intravenous administration of TMP (4 mg/kg) to rats in the absence and presence of FA (5 mg/kg). Samples were collected at timed intervals for the measurement of TMP by a rapid and sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method. 3. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis for brain microdialysates. The brain pharmacokinetic data for TMP showed significant increases in Cmax, t1/2, AUC0-inf and MRT0-inf after combination with FA. After intragastric administration with FA, there were significant decreases in the Tmax (from 38.33 ± 5.77 to 21 ± 5.48 min; p < 0.01) of TMP. This study indicated that potential drug-drug interaction between TMP and FA should be taken into consideration and the combined administration is beneficial in improving the bioavailability of TMP in the brain.",

            "content": "Lychnis mottle virus (LycMoV; genus Unassigned, family Secoviridae) infection of Angelica sinensis produces mottle and mosaic symptoms, damaging the host. Early detection of relevant pathogens is the most critical step in preventing the potential transmission of infectious disease. Polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) with high potency and high specificity were prepared using the recombinant LycMoV capsid protein as an antigen. Here, we developed and optimized a rapid colloidal gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) detection system for LycMoV using this antibody. Under optimum conditions, GICA specifically detected (up to 10,000-fold) positive LycMoV samples. A real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) system was also established by selecting the primers with high sensitivity and specificity to LycMoV. The RT-LAMP detection threshold was 1.42 fg/μl (291 copies/μl). A GICA-RT-LAMP assay system was further established and optimized. The minimum GICA detection line was calculated at 1.52x10-2 ng/μl. Although GICA did not detect positive samples after capturing 2.53x10-3 ng/μl of virus, GICA-LAMP and GICA-RT-PCR did, whose sensitivity was comparatively greater than six-fold. This is the first report showing that GICA-RT-LAMP is a cost effective approach for use in detecting LycMoV without extracting nucleic acids. These sensitive assays will help improve virus disease management in A. sinensis crops.",

These three herbs have differing therapeutic effects and should be used according to their prescribed purposes. In some retail markets, though, all three herbs are known by the same common name rather than a scientific name and can therefore be confused with each other. In particular, in the case of powdered products, intentional or unintentional wrong sales activity by the seller may occur. In this study, non-targeted analysis was performed using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry to discriminate between the three Angelica herbs, and marker compounds were identified by principal component analysis. Principal component analysis was applied to the whole dataset with the variables being sample name, peak name (m/z with retention time), and ion intensity extracted in advance by peak finding, alignment, and filtering. All three herbs were visually and clearly differentiated in the score plot, and the marker compounds that contributed to their discrimination were found in the loading plot through principal component variable grouping (PCVG). Among the marker compounds, coumarins contributed to the classification of A. gigas, and phthalides contributed to the classification of A. sinensis. The three Angelica herbs were well discriminated from each other. Within the three Angelica species investigated, marker compounds can determine the species of even powdered or extracted samples that cannot be visually identified.",

            "content": "Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer sequences were used to infer the phylogenetic affinities and historical biogeography of Angelica and its allies (Apiaceae tribe Selineae), with emphasis on those species of Angelica and Peucedanum endemic to the Hengduan Mountains of south-central China. Results of these analyses corroborate a monophyletic Angelica (Angelica sensu stricto) upon the inclusion of Coelopleurum, Czernaevia, and one of two examined species of Ostericum, but with the exclusion of several species previously attributable to Angelica. Angelica oncosepala and A. likiangensis arise within the genus Heracleum in tribe Tordylieae; the former is recognized under its original name, Heracleum oncosepalum. Angelica sinensis, A. tianmuensis and A. paeoniifolia arise within the Sinodielsia clade of previous circumscription, closely related to Levisticum officinale. Angelica anomala is a sister group to Ostericum grosseserratum in the previously delimited Acronema clade. Angelica apaensis and A. decursiva, taxa whose phylogenetic affinities have previously been controversial, are confirmed within Angelica. Northeast Asia (including Japan, northeast China, Korea and adjacent areas of Russia), Western Europe, and North America are inferred to be ancestral areas of Angelica based on optimal solutions of a dispersal-vicariance analysis, with the Hengduan Mountains likely providing a refugium for Angelica during the latter part of the Tertiary.",

Rats in group A (n = 10), B (n = 10) and C (n = 10) were fed a standard laboratory chow and allowed tap water ad libitum. In group B and C, renal failure was induced by the administration of a diet containing 0.75% adenine for 28 days which began at day 0. Rats in group C were given Chinese herbs (40 ml/kg with drug concentration 1.75 g/ml) beginning at day 0. Urine albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were determined at days 0, 14 and 28. At day 28, the animals were killed and their kidneys removed for light microscope evaluation. Body weight in Group B decreased more significantly than that in Group C (p = 0.032) at day 28. The rats in group B demonstrated more severe proteinuria and higher Serum creatinine and BUN levels than group C at day 14 and day 28 (P < 0.05, 0.01). All rats given adenine developed marked structural renal damage involving the tubule and interstitium. The values were much less severe in group C than those in group B. In adenine-induced chronic renal failure rats, the protective effects of these Chinese herbs were of a significant nature. Our results do support the notion that these Chinese herbs are useful in deferring the advance of chronic renal failure. We recommend Chinese herbs as a beneficial treatment for pre-end stage chronic renal failure.",

All compounds were tested against two pathogenic strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv and Erdman) in vitro in a microplate Alamar Blue assay (MABA). The most potent anti-TB constituents were 1 and 2, exhibiting MIC values of 1.4-26.7 microg/mL; 3 showed moderate MICs (49.5 and 50.2 microg/mL, respectively) while 4 and 5 were weakly active (MIC > 60 microg/mL).

There is an antifibrosis effect of Radix Angelica Sinensis and Radix Hedysari (RAS-RH) ultrafiltration extract from Danggui Buxue decoction (DBD) in X-irradiation-induced rat myocardial fibrosis, and this study aimed to investigate whether that effect correlated with apoptosis and oxidative stress damage in primary rat cardiac fibroblasts; further, the potential mechanisms were also explored. In this study, we first found that the RAS-RH antifibrosis effect was associated with the upregulation of microRNA-200a and the downregulation of TGF-β1/smad3 and COL1α. In addition, we also found that the antifibrosis effect of RAS-RH was related to the induction of apoptosis in primary rat cardiac fibroblasts and to the prevention of damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, primary rat cardiac fibroblasts exposed to X-ray radiation underwent apoptosis less frequently in the absence of RAS-RH. Therefore, RAS-RH has the ability to protect against fibrosis, which could be occurring through the induction of apoptosis and the resistance to oxidative stress in rats with X-irradiation-induced myocardial fibrosis; thus, in a model of RIMF, RAS-RH acts against X-irradiation-induced cardiac toxicity.",

This study aims to explore the therapeutic potential of ASP on glioma, as well as the underlying mechanisms involving microRNA-373-3p (miR-373-3p) and the TGF-β/Smad4 signaling pathway.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      U251 cells (a human glioma cell line) were treated with different concentrations of ASP. miR-373-3p was silenced in U251 cells by the transfection of the miR-373-3p inhibitor. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Cell migration and invasion were detected by wound healing and transwell assays, respectively. The miR-373-3p expression was measured by RT-qPCR. The protein expressions of TGF-β and Smad4 were evaluated by both western blotting and immunofluorescence.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      ASP inhibited the viability, migration, and invasion, and enhanced the apoptosis of U251 cells in a dose-dependent manner. ASP increased miR-373-3p expression and decreased TGF-β and Smad4 expressions in U251 cells. Silencing of miR-373-3p weakened the effects of ASP on inhibiting cell viability, migration, and invasion, as well as promoting cell apoptosis. In addition, deleting miR-373-3p weakened the inhibiting effects of ASP on the TGF-β/Smad4 pathway in U251 cells.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      ASP suppresses the malignant progression of glioma via regulating the miR-373-3p-mediated TGF-β/Smad4 pathway.",

In this study, we report the inhibitory effect of the combined therapy of Astragalus membranaceus and Angelica sinensis, on tumor growth and cachexia in tumor-bearing mice. Lewis lung carcinoma cells were inoculated into male C57BL/6 and CAnN.Cg-Foxn1nu nude mice. After tumor inoculation, mice were fed orally by the combination of AM and AS in different doses. In C57BL/6 mice, the combination of AM and AS significantly inhibited the growth of cancer tumor and prevented the loss of body weight and skeletal muscle. It also diminished the formation of free radicals and cytokines, stimulated the differentiation of NK and Tc cells, and rebalanced the ratios of Th/Tc cells, Th1/Th2 cytokines, and M1/M2 tumor-associated macrophages. The herbal combination also downregulated the expression of NFκΒ, STAT3, HIF-1α, and VEGF in tumors. In contrast, the findings were not observed in the nude mice. Therefore, the combination of AM and AS is confirmed to inhibit the progression of lung cancer, cancer cachexia, and cancer inflammation through the immunomodulatory function.",

            "content": "Given the limited efficacy and potential disadvantages of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in treating anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD), the development of better alternative therapies has become a priority. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) and its underlying mechanism in the treatment of renal anemia. In the present study, we found that ASP could enhance hypoxic induction of EPO in Hep3B cells, with a mechanism that involved the stabilization of HIF-2α protein. In parallel, ASP rescued the inhibition of EPO, induced by proinflammatory factor TNF-α through blocking GATA2 and NF-κB activation. In a rat model of adenine-induced anemia of CKD, oral administration of ASP corrected anemia and alleviated renal damage and inflammation. By increasing the accumulation of HIF-2α protein and reducing the expression of NF-κB and GATA2 as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, ASP stimulated both renal and hepatic EPO production, and resulted in an elevation of serum EPO. The restoration of EPO production and EPOR mRNA expression with ASP treatment activated EPOR downstream JAK2/STAT5 and PI3K/Akt signaling, induced their target genes, such as Bcl-xL, Fam132b and Tfrc, and increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio in bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells of CKD rats. Furthermore, we found that ASP suppressed hepatic hepcidin expression, mobilized iron from spleen and liver and increased serum iron. These findings demonstrate that ASP elicits anti-anemic action by restoring EPO production and improving iron availability in the setting of CKD in rats.",

            "content": "A novel strategy for predicting bioactive components in traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) using live cell extraction and high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS) analysis was proposed. The hypothesis is that when cells are incubated together with the extract of TCM, the potential bioactive components in the TCM should selectively combine with the cells, and the relative concentrations of the cell-combining components in the suspension medium should decrease, while the cell-combining components would be detectable in the extract of denatured cells. The identities of the cell-combining components could be determined by HPLC-DAD-MS analysis. Using the proposed approach, the potential bioactive components of Danggui Buxue decoction, a commonly used TCM for anaemia, and its compositions, Radix Angelica Sinensis and Radix Astragli for endothelial cells, were investigated. Six compounds in the extract of Danggui Buxue decoction were detected as the components selectively combined with endothelial cells, among them two were contributed by Radix Angelica Sinensis, and four by Radix Astragli. The identities of four of the six potential bioactive compounds were elucidated as ononoside, calycosin, 3-butylphthalide and ligustilide by HPLC-DAD-MS analysis. The results indicate that the proposed approach may be applied to predict the bioactive candidates in TCM.",

It is the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors and is associated with a variety of factors, including oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and abnormal myocardial energy metabolism. A number of studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can mitigate chemoradiotherapy-associated cardiotoxicity via these pathways. Therefore, this study reviews the effects and molecular mechanisms of TCM on chemoradiotherapy-related cardiotoxicity. In this study, we searched PubMed for basic studies on the anti-cardiotoxicity of TCM in the past 5 years and summarized their results.

These preparations reduced chemoradiotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity through various pathways such as anti-oxidative stress, anti-inflammation, alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress, regulation of apoptosis and autophagy, and improvement of myocardial energy metabolism. However, few clinical trials have been conducted on these therapies, and these trials can provide stronger evidence-based support for TCM.",

            "content": "Medicinal plants are being used from time immemorial for their therapeutic benefits and have immense value in the therapy of neurodegenerative disorders. One of the most important neurological disorders is Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is a major contributor to dementia and is accompanied by abundant oxidative stress in the brain tissue. A critical pathway to target the increased oxidative stress is to administer agents with antioxidant potential. Despite currently available clinical treatments to treat AD such as cholinesterase inhibitors or NMDA antagonists which address only the symptoms and cannot hamper disease progression, no efficient available clinical treatment can break the vicious cycle of oxidative stress and neurodegeneration till date. The main objective of presenting this review is that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) acts as a promising candidate in breaking this vicious cycle and improves the quality of life of the debilitating patients. The active constituents of various herbs in TCM including Angelica sinensis, Radix polygalae, Polygala tenuifolia, and members of the Lamiaceae family have acquired experience of managing oxidative stress as indicated in the review for more than a thousand years now, and the preclinical and clinical evidence of their therapeutic potential has been highlighted in the review. Most importantly, Chinese herbs provide a multiple-target approach rather than a single-target approach and thus can target multiple pathways involved in AD at once. The Chinese herbs can definitely untangle the issues in the current therapy regimen of AD.",

            "content": "To analyze the intervention mechanism of polysaccharides from charred Angelica sinensis (CASP) on the liver injury caused by Ceftiofur sodium (CS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the perspective of the intestine. Ninety-four one-day-old laying chickens underwent free feeding and drinking water for three days. Then, fourteen laying chickens were randomly selected as the control group, and sixteen laying chickens were selected as the model group. Sixteen laying chickens in the rest were randomly selected as the intervention group of CASP. Chickens in the intervention group were given CASP by the oral administration (0.25 g/kg/d) for 10 days, the control and model groups were given the same amount of physiological saline. During the 8th and 10th days, laying chickens in the model and CASP intervention group were subcutaneously injected with CS at the neck. In contrast, those in the control group were subcutaneously injected with the same amount of normal saline simultaneously. Except for the control group, the layer chickens in the model and CASP intervention groups were injected with LPS after CS injection on the 10th day of the experiment. In contrast, those in the control group were injected with the same amount of normal saline at the same time. 48 h after the experiment, the liver samples of each group were collected, and the liver injury was analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and transmission electron microscopy. And the cecum contents of six-layer chickens in each group were collected, and the intervention mechanism of CASP on the liver injury from the perspective of the intestine was analyzed by the 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing technology and the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) detection of cecal contents based on Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), and their association analysis was carried out. The results showed that the structure of chicken liver in the normal control group was normal, while that in the model group was damaged. The structure of chicken liver in the CASP intervention group was similar to the normal control group. The intestinal floras in the model group were maladjusted compared to the normal control group. After the intervention of CASP, the diversity, and richness of chicken intestinal floras changed significantly. It was speculated that the intervention mechanism of CASP on the chicken liver injury might be related to the abundance and proportion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Compared with the model group, the indexes of ace, chao1, observed species, and PD whole tree of chicken cecum floras in the intervention group of CASP were significantly increased (p < 0.05). The contents of acetic acid, butyric acid, and total SCFAs in the intervention group of CASP were significantly lower than those in the model group (p < 0.05), and the contents of propionic acid and valeric acid in the intervention group of CASP were significantly lower than those in the model group (p < 0.05) and normal control group (p < 0.05). The correlation analysis showed that the changes in the intestinal floras were correlated with the changes in SCFAs in the cecum. It is confirmed that the liver-protecting effect of CASP is indeed related to the changes in the intestinal floras and SCFAs content in the cecum, which provides a basis for screening liver-protecting alternative antibiotics products for poultry.",

Radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis (RIMF) is the final pathological condition of RIHD and main change leading to serious cardiovascular complications following RT. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ultrafiltration extract of Radix Angelica Sinensis and Radix Hedysari (RAS-RH) on the proliferation, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) of cardiac fibroblasts after X-irradiation in vitro. The RAS-RH extract was from the Danggui Buxue decoction (DBD) in TCM. Primary cardiac fibroblasts were irradiated with 1 Gy X-ray to evaluate the effect of RAS-RH on the expression levels of cell proliferation, apoptosis, ROS, and fibrotic molecules. Our data demonstrated that X-irradiation at 1 Gy resulted in the proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts; RAS-RH attenuated the myocardial fibrosis. Furthermore, X-ray radiation reduced the apoptosis of cardiac fibroblasts; RAS-RH accelerated the apoptosis of these cells after irradiation. In addition, the damage driven by ROS in primary cardiac fibroblasts after irradiation was weakened by RAS-RH and the expression of TGF-β1, Col1, and α-SMA increased after irradiation; RAS-RH decreased the expression of these makers.

However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown.,Purpose:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      We investigate whether CPA has neuroprotective effects via suppressing Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and microglial pyroptosis against ischemic injury in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Male rats were divided randomly into sham operated, MCAO, MCC950 (NLRP3-specific inhibitor) and CPA groups. Neurological deficits, glucose uptake, infarct size, activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, microglial pyroptosis and related signaling pathways were detected. BV-2 microglial cells subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) were used in in vitro experiments.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Compared with sham rats, elevated level of proinflammatory interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in plasma, neurological function deficit, reduced glucose uptake in ipsilateral hemisphere, obvious infarct size, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and enhanced microglial pyroptosis were presented in MCAO rats. The administrations of MCC950 and CPA respectively reversed the results. In vitro OGD/R induced the release of lactate dehydrogenase, promoted NLRP3 inflammasomes activation and pyroptosis in BV-2 cells, which was significantly suppressed by treatment with ginsenoside Rd (Rd) and Z-ligustilide (LIG). Mechanistically, OGD/R induced high expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and mitochondrial fission, as well as NLRP3 inflammasomes activation and pyroptosis in BV-2 cells, which was attenuated by treatment with Rd and LIG. Moreover, the increased expression of Drp1 was validated in MCAO rats, and also abolished by MCC950 or CPA treatments.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      CPA treatment attenuates cerebral injury via inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasomes activation and microglial pyroptosis after stroke, which at least partially involved in the amelioration of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission.",

However, until recently, few studies had explored its antidepressant effect. The current study attempts to investigate the effect of AS extracts on chronic unpredictable mild stress- (CUMS-) induced depression in rats. Male SD rats were exposed to a CUMS-inducing procedure for 5 weeks, resulting in rodent depressive behaviors that included reduced sucrose consumption and lessened sucrose preference ratios in sucrose preference test, prolonged immobility times and decreased struggling time in force swim test, and decreased locomotor activity in open field test. Moreover, the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK 1/2) were markedly decreased in the hippocampus in depressed rats. However, chronically treating the depressed rats with AS (1 g/kg) normalized their depression-related behaviors and molecular profiles. In conclusion, in the present study, we show that AS extracts exerted antidepressant effects that were mediated by the BDNF signaling pathway: in AS-treated depressed rats, the expression of the BDNF protein and the phosphorylation of its downstream targets (ERK 1/2, CREB) were upregulated in the hippocampus.",

The first pump was used for on-line solid phase extraction with a Cyclone™ SPE column. Chromatographic separations were performed with the other pump on a Syncronis C18 rapid analytical column. The analytical column was eluted by a gradient program that featured an acetonitrile/methanol/water gradient (flow-rate, 0.4ml/min). DGLC afforded greater convenience for bioanalysis. All analytes were simultaneously monitored in positive- and negative-ion mode by SRM (selective reaction monitoring) using the fast polarity switch speed of TSQ Vantage™. Method validation of the assay was implemented. No significant matrix effect was observed. The LLOQ of all analytes were <1.0ng/ml.

We have also analyzed the evidence level of clinical studies.,Main outcome measures:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The main outcome assessed is the efficacy of plants in improving the symptoms of FSD.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      There is little evidence from the literature to recommend the use of medicinal plants when treating FSD. The majority of studies with a strong level of evidence are associated with the treatment of the vasomotor symptoms of menopause. Ferula hermonis, Angelica sinensis, and Gingko biloba may be suggested for arousal disorder studies. Cimicifuga racemosa, Trifolium pratense, and Vitex agnus-castus may be recommended for several FSD. Humulus lupulus and Tribulus terrestris may help with desire disorder studies. Lepidium meyenii should be studied further.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Studies of these plants indicate that they may be useful as a possible alternative and/or complementary approach for studies aimed at the treatment of FSD. At this time, however, this review cannot recommend a plant that has a strong enough level of evidence for treatment of FSD. Thus, there is a need for clinical (double-blinded and randomized) studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of several plants that can exert a positive effect on the management of FSD.",

            "content": "Adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer reduces recurrence rates and prolongs survival at the cost of both acute and chronic toxicities. Breast cancer survivors who have received adjuvant chemotherapy may suffer from late effects of chemotherapy including congestive heart failure, neuropathy, premature menopause, and osteoporosis. Nutritional approaches to these problems are distinct in their orientation and success. Study of free radical scavengers for anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy was born from known pathogenetic mechanisms of cardiotoxicity but has been universally disappointing thus far in clinical trials. Application of agents used for diabetic neuropathy suggests that evening primrose oil, alpha-lipoic acid, and capsaicin may all play a role in the empiric options available to patients with chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. Plant-derived preparations including black cohosh (Actaea racemosa), dong quai (Angelica sinensis), evening primrose (Oenothera biennis), and red clover (Trifolium pretense) are used by patients experiencing hot flashes due to premature menopause despite a paucity of clinical trial data demonstrating either safety or efficacy. Calcium and vitamin D are widely accepted as an effective means to retard bone loss leading to osteoporosis. Nutritional approaches to late effects of breast cancer chemotherapy offer the prospect of preventing or ameliorating these sequelae of treatment. However, except for vitamin D and calcium for prevention of bone loss, current clinical evidence supporting use of nutritional agents remains sparse.",

The unique properties of this HPLC fingerprints were validated by analyzing 13 related herbs including 4 Japanese Angelicae Root samples (JA, A. acutiloba Kitagawa and A. acutiloba Kitagawa var. sugiyame Hikino), 6 Szechwan Lovage Rhizome samples (SL, Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort.) and 3 Cnidium Rhizome samples (CR, Cnidium officinale Makino). Both correlation coefficients of similarity in chromatograms and relative peak areas of characteristic compounds were calculated for quantitative expression of the HPLC fingerprints. The amount of senkyunolide A in CA was less than 30-fold of that in SL and CR samples, which was used as a chemical marker to distinguish them. JA was easily distinguished from CA, SL and CR based on either chromatographic patterns or the amount of coniferyl ferulate. No obvious difference between SL and CR chromatograms except the relative amount of some compounds, suggesting that SL and CR might have very close relationship in terms of chemotaxonomy.

A total of 54 compounds released from all of these varieties of Angelica rhizomes were separated and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The composition of supercritical extracts from these plants was very different from the solid-phase microextraction products. More compounds were detected by SPME-GC-MS (41) than by SFE-GC-MS (17). The results of these analyses suggest that SFE may be useful for detecting the main components, decursinol angelate and decursin in Korean danggui, and butylidene dihydro-phthalide in both Chinese and Japanese danggui, whereas the results for SPME did not. The SFE method required specialized instrumentation, required little time to prepare the sample, and had a small sample size and no organic solvent. In sum, these results suggest that SFE is useful for extracting the volatile main components of danggui cultivars. Its simplicity, low cost and speed may allow SPME to increase the recovery of volatile components in general without disturbing the main components of the plant.",

Kinetic analysis and computational docking were used to examine the mechanism of GST inhibition by CF. Computational docking found that CF could be fully docked into the gorge of GSTP1-1. The further exploration of the mechanisms showed that CF was a reversible noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to GSH and CDNB, and it has much less cytotoxicity. Apoptosis and the expression of P-gp mRNA were evaluated in the MDR positive B-MD-C1 (ADR+/+) cell line to investigate the MDR reversal effect of CF. Moreover, CF showed strong apoptogenic activity and could markedly decrease the overexpressed P-gp.

            "content": "Danggui is a popular traditional Chinese medicinal (TCM) herb which is easily obtained by the public. The effects of Danggui on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin were studied in rabbits. Single subcutaneous doses (2 mg/kg) of warfarin were administered to 6 rabbits with or without 3 days treatment with oral Danggui extracts (2 g/kg twice daily). Plasma warfarin concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for 72 h after each of the two warfarin doses. The prothrombin time (PT) was measured daily for 3 days both during the Danggui treatment period and after warfarin doses. Danggui treatment did not affect PT on its own, but significantly lowered PT values 3 days after co-treatment with single dose warfarin. No significant variations in the single dose pharmacokinetic parameters of warfarin were observed after Danggui treatment. A separate group of 6 rabbits were given daily subcutaneous doses of warfarin (0.6 mg/kg) to achieve steady state level, followed by 3 day treatment with oral Danggui extract (2 g/kg twice daily). The slight increase in PT was not significant and two rabbits died after day 7 of the treatment period. However, there was no significant difference in steady state concentrations of warfarin after the Danggui treatment. Results indicate that precautionary advice should be given to patients who self-medicate with Danggui or other TCM products while on chronic treatment with warfarin.",

            "content": "Introduction: Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) genes play a crucial role in green plants' responding to various pathogens. Genome-scale evolutionary studies of NLR genes are important for discovering and applying functional NLR genes. However, little is known about the evolution of NLR genes in the Apiaceae family including agricultural and medical plants. Methods: In this study, comparative genomic analysis was performed in four Apiaceae species to trace the dynamic evolutionary patterns of NLR genes during speciation in this family. Results: The results revealed different number of NLR genes in these four Apiaceae species, namely, Angelica sinensis (95), Coriandrum sativum (183), Apium graveolens (153) and Daucus carota (149). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that NLR genes in these four species were derived from 183 ancestral NLR lineages and experienced different levels of gene-loss and gain events. The contraction pattern of the ancestral NLR lineages was discovered during the evolution of D. carota, whereas a different pattern of contraction after first expansion of NLR genes was observed for A. sinensis, C. sativum and A. graveolens. Discussion: Taken together, rapid and dynamic gene content variation has shaped evolutionary history of NLR genes in Apiaceae species.",

            "content": "The rhizome of Angelica gigas Nakai, Angelica sinensis Diels and Angelica acutiloba Kitagawa (Umbelliferae) were chopped and extracted by hydrodistillation (HD) and solvent free solid injector (SFSI) methods to obtain the volatile compounds that were then characterized and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). SFSI extraction yielded a generally higher amount of volatile compounds than that produced by HD. A total of 48 components [including terpenes (8), aldehydes (4), alcohol (2), coumarins (9), Phthalide (3), acids (2) and sterols (2)] were identified by SFSI and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry from the three species of danggui cultivars, whereas, 24-essential oil was obtained by HD for Korean danggui only. According to these analyses, several coumarin derivatives such as decursinol angelate (16.83%) and decursin (29.34%) were found to be the dominant ones, followed by lomatin (10.25%) and marmesin (9.33%) in Korean danggui. Furfural and butylidene phthalide were the main components in Japanese in addition to butylidene dihydro-phthalide in Chinese danggui. Some parameters affecting the extraction efficiency such as injector temperature, injection time and pre-heating time were optimized. The results showed that the SFSI-method gave a higher yield of components with higher molecular mass than hydrodistillation. SFSI required little time to prepare the sample, little sample mass and a small quantity of organic solvent was needed. It can be concluded that analysis of volatile flavor compounds by SFSI in combination with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry is a suitable monitoring technique to differentiate danggui cultivars.",

            "content": "Colon-specific drug delivery systems are clinically necessary to treat colon diseases locally while minimizing systemic side effects. In this study, we extracted angelica polysaccharide from fresh roots of Angelica sinensis Diels and analyzed the monosaccharide components. With succinate as a cross-linker and angelica polysaccharide as a drug carrier, a dexamethasone-polysaccharide conjugate was synthesized. The amount of dexamethasone (Dex) loaded in the dexamethasone-polysaccharide conjugate was 14.13/100 mg. The newly synthesized dexamethasone-polysaccharide conjugate was found to greatly reduce systemic absorption of Dex and effectively deliver Dex to the large intestine. When dexamethasone-polysaccharide conjugate was used to treat TNBS-induced ulcerative colitis in rats by gavage, the ulcerative area of the colon and the colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was reduced in a dose-dependent manner. There was no effects on spleen weight, thymus weight, or peripheral blood lymphocyte count (0.25 micromol kg(-1) day(-1)). These results indicate that the dexamethasone-polysaccharide conjugate has a therapeutic effect on TNBS-induced ulcerative colitis in rats, while simultaneously reducing the systemic immunosuppression caused by Dex. Thus, the angelica polysaccharide was a promising colon-specific drug carrier, and the new dexamethasone-polysaccharide conjugate may yield a potential drug for the treatment of human inflammatory bowel disease.",

The extensive pathological activities of AP have been discovered in disparate diseases. Nevertheless, the impression of AP in epilepsy (EP) remains unaware. The research attempted to probe the impact of AP on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-evoked inflammatory injury in HT22 cells. Methods: AP were exploited to stimulate HT22 cells, cell cytotoxicity was monitored by CCK-8 assay. LPS was utilized to administrate HT22 cells to evoke inflammatory injury, meanwhile the involvements of AP in cell proliferation, apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines productions were examined. MicroRNA-10a (miR-10a) inhibitor and its negative control were one by one transfected into HT22 cells, the effect of miR-10a inhibition on LPS- and AP-treated cells was determined. NF-κB and JAK2/STAT3 pathways were ultimately detected. Results: AP promoted cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis and suppressed IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 productions in LPS-stimulated HT22 cells. Additionally, AP raised miR-10a expression in HT22 cells administration with LPS. These functions of AP in LPS-disposed cells were conversed by miR-10a suppression. Further, AP interdicted NF-κB and JAK2/STAT3 pathways via enhancing miR-10a. Conclusions: Data corroboarted that AP mitigated LPS-evoked inflammatory injury through repression of NF-κB and JAK2/STAT3 pathways by regulating miR-10a in HT22 cells.",

            "content": "DNA barcodes have been increasingly used in authentication of medicinal plants, while their wide application in materia medica is limited in their accuracy due to incomplete sampling of species and absence of identification for materia medica. In this study, 95 leaf accessions of 23 species (including one variety) and materia medica of three Pharmacopoeia-recorded species of Angelica in China were collected to evaluate the effectiveness of four DNA barcodes (rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA and ITS). Our results showed that ITS provided the best discriminatory power by resolving 17 species as monophyletic lineages without shared alleles and exhibited the largest barcoding gap among the four single barcodes. The phylogenetic analysis of ITS showed that Levisticum officinale and Angelica sinensis were sister taxa, which indicates that L. officinale should be considered as a species of Angelica. The combination of ITS + rbcL + matK + trnH-psbA performed slight better discriminatory power than ITS, recovering 23 species without shared alleles and 19 species as monophyletic clades in ML tree. Authentication of materia medica using ITS revealed that the decoction pieces of A. sinensis and A. biserrata were partially adulterated with those of L. officinale, and the temperature around 80 °C processing A. dahurica decoction pieces obviously reduced the efficiency of PCR and sequencing.

            "content": "Inflammation is a ubiquitous host response in charge of restoring normal tissue structure and function but is a double-edged sword, as the uncontrolled or excessive process can lead to the injury of host cells, chronic inflammation, chronic diseases, and also neoplastic transformation. Throughout history, a wide range of species has been claimed to have anti-inflammatory effects worldwide. Among them, Angelica sinensis, Tropaeolum majus, Castilleja tenuiflora, Biophytum umbraculum, to name just a few, have attracted the scientific and general public attention in the last years. Efforts have been made to assess their relevance through a scientific method. However, inflammation is a complex interdependent process, and phytomedicines are complex mixtures of compounds with multiple mechanisms of biological actions, which restricts systematic explanation. For this purpose, the omics techniques could prove extremely useful. They provide tools for interpreting and integrating results from both the classical medical tradition and modern science. As a result, the concept of network pharmacology applied to phytomedicines emerged. All of this is a step toward personalized therapy.",

The Chinese Pharmacopoeia records more than 100 herbal formulae containing Angelica roots. There are two common sources of Angelica roots, Angelica sinensis from China and A. gigas from Korea. The two species of Angelica roots differ in their chemical compositions, pharmacological properties and clinical efficacy. ¹H-NMR metabolic profiling has recently emerged as a promising quality control method for food and herbal chemistry. We explored the use of ¹H-NMR metabolic profiling for the quality control of Angelica Radix. Unlike previous work, we performed the metabolic profiling on hot water extracts, so as to mimic the clinically relevant preparation method. Unsupervised principle component analyses of both the full spectral profile and a selection of targeted molecules revealed a clear differentiation of three types of Angelica roots. In addition, the levels of 13 common metabolites were measured. Statistically significant differences in the levels of glucose, fructose and threonine were found between different sources of Angelica. Ferulic acid, a marker commonly used to evaluate Angelica root, was detected in our samples, but the difference in ferulic acid levels between the samples was not statistically significant. Overall, we successfully applied ¹H-NMR metabolic profiling with water extraction to discriminate all three sources of Angelica roots, and obtained quantitative information of many common metabolites.",

Astragalus membranaceus and angelica sinensis are commonly used traditional Chinese medicines for enriching the blood. In the current study astragaloside IV (AT, the main active ingredient of astragalus) and ferulic acid (FA, the main ingredient of angelica) were loaded into electrospun fibrous scaffolds to provide abundant and sustained biological factors required to initiate vascularization and bring it to maturity. The cell viability after AT and FA treatment was dose-dependent with an optimal concentration of around 50 μg/mL, and the most significant synergistic effect was demonstrated for the combined treatment with AT and FA with the ratio of 7/3 on both primary endothelial and smooth muscle cells. The in vitro release study showed that the amount of AT and FA release could be regulated by their loading amount and ratios in electrospun fibers. The localized and sustained codelivery of AT and FA indicated significantly high cell viability and secretion of extracellular matrices for both endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and induced significantly high densities of vascular structures after subcutaneous implantation. The most significant angiogenesis promotion with few inflammatory reactions was demonstrated for electrospun fibers containing AT and FA with the ratio of 7/3. It was suggested that the integration of the synergistic effect of Chinese medicine into electrospun fibrous scaffolds should provide clinical relevance for therapeutic vascularization, full vascularization in engineered tissues, and regeneration of blood vessel substitutes.",

We focus on the plant related microorganisms, including endophytes and rhizosphere microorganisms, by combining the traditional isolation and culture method with metagenomic sequencing technology. We found that the OTUs of endophytes and rhizosphere microorganisms showed a positive correlation in the whole growth stage of P. praeruptorum. Meanwhile, the community diversity of endophytic and rhizosphere fungi showed an opposite change trend, and bacteria showed a similar change trend. Besides, the microbial communities differed during the pre- and post-bolting stages of P. praeruptorum. Beneficial bacterial taxa, such as Pseudomonas and Burkholderia, and fungal taxa, such as Didymella and Fusarium, were abundant in the roots in the pre-bolting stage. Further, a strain belonging to Didymella was obtained by traditional culture and was found to contain praeruptorin A, praeruptorin B, praeruptorin E.

Based on the history of use, there was strong clinical support that Radix polygalae is memory improving. Pharmacological investigation also indicated that all the five ingredients mentioned above can elicit memory-improving effects in vivo and in vitro via multiple mechanisms of action, covering estrogen-like, cholinergic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, neurogenetic, and anti-Aβ activities. Furthermore, 11 active principles were identified, including sinapic acid, tenuifolin, isoliquiritigenin, liquiritigenin, glabridin, ferulic acid, Z-ligustilide, N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide, coniferyl ferulate and 11-angeloylsenkyunolide F, and catalpol.

It was found that Dang Gui increased and GB decreased the production of IL-2. In the control experiments for immuno-modulating effect, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was found to suppress and indomethacin to increase IL-2 production. The stimulatory effect of Dang Gui was totally abrogated by PGE2.",

Transfection was performed to alter the expression of COX-1.

Here we explored their discrepancy in chemical constituents and transcriptome.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      ASR were separated into three medicinal parts: heads (rootstocks with petiole traces of ASR), bodies (taproots of ASR) and tails (lateral roots of ASR), and chemical and transcriptomic analyses were conducted simultaneously.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprint results showed that five widely used active ingredients (ferulic acid, senkyunolide H, senkyunolide A, n-butylphathlide, and ligustilide) were distributed unevenly in the three ASR medicinal parts. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) demonstrated that the heads can be differentiated from the two other root parts due to different amounts of the main components. However, the content of ferulic acid (a main quality marker) was significantly higher in tails than in the heads and bodies. The transcriptome analysis found that 25,062, 10,148 and 29,504 unigenes were specifically expressed in the heads, bodies and tails, respectively. WGCNA analysis identified 17 co-expression modules, which were constructed from the 19,198 genes in the nine samples of ASR. Additionally, we identified 28 unigenes involved in two phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (PB) pathways about ferulic acid metabolism pathways, of which 17 unigenes (60.7%) in the PB pathway were highly expressed in the tails. The expression levels of PAL, C3H, and CQT transcripts were significantly higher in the tails than in other root parts. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that PAL, C3H, and CQT genes were predominantly expressed in the tail parts, especially PAL, whose expression was more than doubled as compared with that in other root parts.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Chemical and transcriptomic analyses revealed the distribution contents and pivotal transcripts of the ferulic acid biosynthesis-related pathways.

            "content": "Traditional herbal patent medicine typically consists of multiple ingredients, making it challenging to supervise contamination by impurities and the improper use of raw materials. This study employed shotgun metabarcoding for the species identification of biological ingredients in traditional herbal patent medicine, Wuhu San. The five prescribed herbal materials found in Wuhu San were collected, and their reference sequences were obtained by traditional DNA barcoding using Sanger sequencing. Two lab-made and three commercial Wuhu San samples were collected, and a total of 37.14 Gb of shotgun sequencing data was obtained for these five samples using the Illumina sequencing platform. A total of 1,421,013 paired-end reads were enriched for the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2), psbA and trnH intergenic spacer region (psbA-trnH), maturase k (matK), and ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) regions. Furthermore, 80, 11, 9, and 8 operational taxonomic units were obtained for the ITS2, psbA-trnH, matK, and rbcL regions, respectively, after metagenomic assembly, annotation, and chimeric detection. In the two lab-made mock samples, all labeled ingredients in the Wuhu San prescription were successfully detected, and the positive control, Panax quinquefolius L., was detected in the HSZY172 mock sample. Three species, namely Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, Saposhnikovia divaricata (Turcz. ex Ledeb.) Schischk., and Carthamus tinctorius L., belonging to three labeled ingredients, Angelicae Sinensis Radix (Danggui), Saposhnikoviae Radix (Fangfeng), and Carthami Flos (Honghua), were detected in the three commercial samples. Angelica dahurica (Hoffm.) Benth. & Hook. f. ex Franch. & Sav., the original Angelicae Dahuricae Radix (Baizhi) species, was only detected in WHS003. Arisaema erubescens (Wall.) Schott, Arisaema heterophyllum Blume, or Arisaema amurense Maxim., the original Arisaematis Rhizoma (Tiannanxing) species, were not detected in any of the commercial samples, which could be attributed to the fact that this medicinal material underwent extensive processing. In addition, the Saposhnikovia divaricata adulterant was detected in all the commercial samples, while 24 fungal genera, including Aspergillus, were identified in both the lab-made and commercial samples. This study showed that shotgun metabarcoding provided alternative strategy and technical means for identifying prescribed ingredients in traditional herbal patent medicine and displayed the potential to effectively complement traditional methods.",

            "content": "Safrole-2',3'-oxide (SAFO) is a reactive electrophilic metabolite of the hepatocarcinogen safrole, the main component of sassafras oil. Safrole occurs naturally in a variety of spices and herbs, including the commonly used Chinese medicine Xi xin (Asari Radix et Rhizoma) and Dong quai (Angelica sinensis). SAFO is the most mutagenic metabolite of safrole tested in the Ames test. However, little or no data are available on the genotoxicity of SAFO in mammalian systems. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of SAFO in human HepG2 cells and male FVB mice. Using MTT assay, SAFO exhibited a dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effect in HepG2 cells with TC(50) values of 361.9μM and 193.2μM after 24 and 48h exposure, respectively. In addition, treatment with SAFO at doses of 125μM and higher for 24h in HepG2 cells resulted in a 5.1-79.6-fold increase in mean Comet tail moment by the alkaline Comet assay and a 2.6-7.8-fold increase in the frequency of micronucleated binucleated cells by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. Furthermore, repeated intraperitoneal administration of SAFO (15, 30, 45, and 60mg/kg) to mice every other day for a total of twelve doses caused a significant dose-dependent increase in mean Comet tail moment in peripheral blood leukocytes (13.3-43.4-fold) and in the frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes (1.5-5.8-fold). Repeated administration of SAFO (60mg/kg) to mice caused liver lesions manifested as a rim of ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes immediately surrounding the central vein. Our data clearly demonstrate that SAFO significantly induced cytotoxicity, DNA strand breaks, micronuclei formation both in human cells in vitro and in mice. More studies are needed to explore the role SAFO plays in safrole-induced genotoxicity.",

With this in mind we sought to examine the literature for examples of complementary and alternative medicines that reduce inflammation, and to place the results of this search in the context of our own work in a mouse model of influenza disease, using a pharmaceutical agent with anti-inflammatory properties. Two Chinese herbs, Angelica sinensis (Dang Gui) and Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), have been recently shown to protect mice during lethal experimental sepsis via inhibition of the novel inflammatory cytokine High Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1). Biochanin A, a ligand of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) alpha and gamma and the active isoflavone in Trifolium pratense (red clover), has anti-inflammatory properties, and thus could be used as an influenza treatment. This is of great interest since we have recently shown that gemfibrozil, a drug used to treat hyperlipidemia in humans and a synthetic ligand of PPAR alpha, significantly reduces the mortality associated with influenza infections in mice. The inflammation-modulating abilities of these natural agents should be considered in light of what is now known about the mechanisms of fatal influenza, and tested as potential candidates for influenza treatments in their own right, or as adjunct treatments to antivirals.",

The supplementations were administered via oral gavage. During the 21-day treatment period, the exercised groups were subjected to a protocol of swimming training with a gradually increased load. Physical performance evaluation was assessed using the forelimb grip strength test and an exhaustive swimming test. Muscle glycogen contents and exercise-related biochemical parameters were analysed.Results: Both herbal supplementations remarkably increased the grip strength (DG by 49.7% and DBT by 85.7%) and prolonged the swimming time (DG by 48.4% and DBT by 72.7%) compared with SE. DBT spared a certain amount of glycogen in the muscle cells under exercise training. Regarding the regulation of fuel usage, DBT had a positive impact alongside ET on promoting aerobic glycolysis via significantly decreasing serum lactate by 31.6% and lactic dehydrogenase levels by 61.8%.Conclusions: This study found that DBT could be considered a promising sports ergogenic aid for athletic population or fitness enthusiasts.

Angelica polysaccharide (AP) is the main component of angelica sinensis, and is widely used for treating various diseases. However, the effects of AP on osteoporosis have not been investigated. This study aimed to uncover the functions of AP in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) proliferation and osteoblast differentiation.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      MSCs were treated with different concentrations of AP, and then cell viability, Cyclin D1 protein level, and the osteogenic markers of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), osteocalcin (OCN), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) were examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and western blot assays, respectively. The effect of AP on the main signalling pathways of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and Wnt/β-catenin was determined by western blot. Following this, si-H19#1 and si-H19#2 were transfected into MSCs, and the effects of H19 on cell proliferation and osteoblast differentiation in MSCs were studied. Finally, in vivo experimentation explored bone mineral density, bone mineral content, and the ash weight and dry weight of femoral bone.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The results revealed that AP significantly promoted cell viability, upregulated cyclin D1 and increased RUNX2, OCN, ALP, and BMP-2 protein levels in MSCs. Moreover, we found that AP notably activated PI3K/AKT and Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathways in MSCs. Additionally, the relative expression level of H19 was upregulated by AP in a dose-dependent manner. The promoting effects of AP on cell proliferation and osteoblast differentiation were reversed by H19 knockdown. Moreover, in vivo experimentation further confirmed the promoting effect of AP on bone formation.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      These data indicate that AP could promote MSC proliferation and osteoblast differentiation by regulating H19.Cite this article: X.

Then, a mathematic model relating the chemical compositions and their activities in inhibiting mice uterine contraction was established for hypothesis of the bioactive compounds based on chemometrics. As a result, nine compounds which might contribute to the inhibition of oxytocin-induced uterine contraction were selected, and the activities of some of them were further confirmed by our experiments and/or the literature.

            "content": "Chinese traditional herbs are used widely as feed supplements to improve the immune response and antioxidant capacity of livestock. Twenty early-weaned 4-month-old yak calves (72.3 ± 3.65 kg) were divided randomly into four groups (n = 5 per group); three groups were provided with supplementary 80 mL/kg DMI of the root water extracts of either Angelica sinensis, Codonopsis pilosula or Glycyrrhiza uralensis, and one group (control) was not provided with a supplement. Compared to control calves, calves consuming the three herbal extracts increased serum concentrations of albumin (ALB) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), but decreased serum concentrations of free fatty acids (FFAs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) (p < 0.05). Calves consuming A. sinensis decreased (p < 0.05) serum concentration of total cholesterol (TC), and increased (p < 0.05) serum concentration of total proteins (TP). Serum FFA concentrations increased (p = 0.004) linearly with time in the control group, but not in the groups consuming herbs. Serum metabolomic data demonstrated that A. sinensis and C. pilosula regulate mainly amino acid metabolism, while G. uralensis regulates mainly carbon and amino acid metabolism. It was concluded that the three herbal root extracts, as dietary supplements, improved energy and nitrogen metabolism, and enhanced the antioxidant capacity of yak calves.",

The ratios of HPR residues/wheat straw [based on total solids (TS), of wheat straw] were 3, 5, and 10%, respectively. The digesters were at 37 ± 1°C of water bath during 30 days of anaerobic digestion. The results showed that HPR had significant effects on the anaerobic co-digestion. The highest biogas productivity was achieved when treated with 10% Pseudo-ginseng residues (PGR), which yielded 337 ml/g TS of biogas and 178 ml/g TS of methane. Cumulative production of biogas and methane increased by 28 and 37% compared to the production achieved in the control. These results suggest that PGR is an effective HPR to enhance the production of methane.",

Previous studies have shown that it has anticancer effects. This report validates in vivo antitumor properties of TNS. The compounds contained in TNSE were confirmed by liquid chromatographmass spectrometer (LC-MS) analysis. The in vivo antitumor activity of TNS extract (TNSE) was tested by feeding it to athymic mice harboring a human colonic tumor subcutaneous xenograft. Toxicity was monitored by recording behavior and weight parameters. Seven compounds were detected in TNSE by LC-MS. TNSE was fed to athymic mice for 2 weeks. No adverse reactions were reported. Compared to the control group, administration of TNSE to tumor bearing mice significantly reduced both tumor weight and volume. The expressions of p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-p70s6k1, VEGF, and CD31 were significantly reduced, the expression levels of cleaved Caspase-9 and cleaved Caspase-3 were significantly increased in the TNSE groups compared to the control group as determined by western blot and immunohistochemistry.

Due to the increase of the elution speed on the second dimensional monolithic column, the first dimensional column efficiency and analysis rate can be greatly improved as comparing with conventionally second dimensional column. The developed system was applied to analysis of methanol extraction of two umbelliferae herbs Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. and Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels by using CN column as for the first dimensional separation and a silica monolithic ODS column for the second dimensional separation, and the obtained three-dimensional chromatograms were treated by normalization of peak heights with the value of the highest peak or setting a certain value using a software written in-house. It was observed that much more peaks for low-abundant components in TCM extract can clearly be detected here than we reported before, due to the large difference for the amount of components in TCMs' extract. With the above improvements in separation performance and data treatment, totally about 120 components in methanol extraction of Rhizoma chuanxiong and 100 in A. sinensis were separated with UV detection within 130 min. This result meant that both the number of peaks detected increase twice but the analysis time decrease twice if comparing with the previously reported result.",

            "content": "Most of traditional Chinese medicine substances come from herbal plants. The medicinal quality of herbal plants varies with the locations of cultivation, the parts of the herb collected, the season of the herb collected, and the herb processing method. Polysaccharides are major components of the herb plants and their biosynthesis is partly controlled by the genes but mostly influenced by the availability of the nutrition and determined by the various environmental factors. In recent decades, polysaccharides isolated from different kinds of Chinese herbs have received much attention due to their important biological activities, such as anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, radiation protecting, antiviral, hypolipidemic, and immunomodulatory activities. Interestingly, different batches of the same herb can obtain different polysaccharide fractions with subtle differences in molecular weight, monosaccharide compositions, glycosidic linkages, and biological functions. Even with these variations, a large number of bioactive polysaccharides from different kinds of traditional Chinese herbs have been purified, characterized, and reported. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the latest polysaccharide extraction methods and the strategies used for monosaccharide compositional analysis plus polysaccharide structural characterization. Most importantly, the reported chemical characteristics and biological activities of the polysaccharides from the famous traditional Chinese herbs including Astragalus membranaceus, Ginseng, Lycium barbarum, Angelica sinensis, Cordyceps sinensis, and Ophiopogon japonicus will be reviewed and discussed. The published studies provide evidence that polysaccharides from traditional Chinese herbs play an important role in their medical applications, which forms the basis for future research, development, and application of these polysaccharides as functional foods and therapeutics in modern medicine.",

Angelica Polysaccharide (AP) is one of the most major active components isolated from the root of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels. This study aimed to investigate the effects of AP on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced SCI cell injury model (PC-12 cell injury model).,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Cell viability was detected using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed using Guava Nexin assay. qRT-PCR was conducted to measure the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and microRNA-223 (miR-223). Cell transfection was performed to up-regulate the expression of miR-223.

Mechanistically, we revealed that AP pre-treatment attenuated LPS-induced miR-223 expression level increase in PC-12 cells. Overexpression of miR-223 reversed the protective effects of AP pre-treatment on LPS-treated PC-12 cells. Furthermore, we pointed out that AP pre-treatment inactivated NF-κB pathway in LPS-treated PC-12 cells by down-regulating miR-223.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      AP protected PC-12 cells from LPS-induced inflammatory injury at least partially by down-regulating miR-223 and then inactivating NF-κB pathway.

Firstly, the concentration of main active substances in AWE was determined and the chemical components were identified by UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS/MS. A drug-induced abortion model was established by mifepristone and misoprostol. After administration AWE (2.16 g/kg) for 7 days, the coagulation function, serum hormone levels, H&E staining, and immunohistochemistry observation of uterus were detected. In addition, serum metabolites profiles were performed on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The contents of ferulic acid, senkyunolide A, and ligustilide in AWE were 0.7276, 0.0868, and 1.9908 mg/g, respectively. Twenty-six compounds were identified in AWE. It was found that AWE was effective in regulation of coagulation function and promoting endometrial recovery. Meanwhile, the levels of E2, Pg, and HCG and the expression of ERα, Erβ, and PR were down-regulated in AUB model and up-regulated by the treatment of AWE. Twenty-one potential biomarkers were eventually identified by multivariate statistical analysis. Study indicated that glycerophospholipid, sphingolipid, amino acids, retinol metabolism and primary bile acid biosynthesis were the main related metabolic pathways involved for the treatment of AUB by AWE.

Previous research has reported that ligustilide has anti-cancer effects on several types of cancer cells. However, studies of ligustilide on oral cancer cells have not been reported, especially under hypoxic conditions. This study focuses on the molecular mechanism of ligustilide-induced apoptosis in hypoxic oral cancer cells. We found that in hypoxic TW2.6 cells, ligustilide inhibited cell migration and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Accumulation of c-Myc accompanied by BH3-only members suggests that ligustilide may induce c-Myc-dependent apoptosis. In addition, we reported that ligustilide has an effect on ER-stress signaling. By using inhibitors of c-Myc, IRE1α, and ER-stress inhibitors, we found that cell morphologies or cell viability were rescued to some degree. Moreover, ligustilide is able to increase the expression of γ-H2AX and enhance the occurrence of DNA damage in oral cancer cells after radiation treatment. This result suggests that ligustilide has potential as a radiation sensitizer. Altogether, we propose that ligustilide may induce c-Myc-dependent apoptosis via ER-stress signaling in hypoxic oral cancer cells.",

However, its effects on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated yet. The current study was designed to investigate the hypoglycemic potential by which RG affects the pathogenesis of T2DM. Comprehensive insights into the effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of RG on attenuating aberrant metabolism of glucose were determined in high-fat diet-induced T2DM mice and insulin-resistant (IR) HepG2 cells. In high-fat diet-induced C57BL/6J mice, RG administration significantly reduced hyperglycemia, decreased hyperinsulinemia, and ameliorated glucose intolerance. Mechanistically, RG activated PPARγ and insulin signaling pathway to improve insulin sensitivity, and increase glucose uptake as well as glycogenesis. In addition, RG also upregulated AMPK-TORC2-FoxO1 axis to attenuate gluconeogenesis in vivo and in vitro. According to the findings, RG may be a promising candidate for the treatment of T2DM.",

            "content": "Ferulic acid, a component of the plants Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels and Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort, exerts a neuroprotective effect by regulating various signaling pathways. This study showed that ferulic acid treatment prevents the injury-induced increase of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2) in focal cerebral ischemia. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) regulates CRMP-2 function through phosphorylation of CRMP-2. Moreover, the pro-apoptotic activity of GSK-3β is inactivated by phosphorylation by Akt. This study investigated whether ferulic acid modulates the expression of CRMP-2 and its upstream targets, Akt and GSK-3β, in focal cerebral ischemia. Male rats were treated immediately with ferulic acid (100 mg/kg, i.v.) or vehicle after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and then cerebral cortices were collected 24 hr after MCAO. MCAO resulted in decreased levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-GSK-3β, while ferulic acid treatment prevented the decrease in the levels of these proteins. Moreover, phospho-CRMP-2 and CRMP-2 levels increased during MCAO, whereas ferulic acid attenuated these injury-induced increases. These results demonstrate that ferulic acid regulates the Akt/GSK-3β/CRMP-2 signaling pathway in focal cerebral ischemic injury, thereby protecting against brain injury.",

            "content": "Osteoporosis is a widespread problem afflicting millions of people. Drynol Cibotinis is a newly developed proprietary botanical combination of eight botanicals including Angelica sinensis, Glycine max, Wild yam, Ligustrum lucidum, Astragalus membranaceus, Cuscuta chinensis, Psoraleae corylifoliae, and Drynaria fortune. Each of the botanicals has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat osteoporosis. The effect of Drynol Cibotinis, with the specific combination of these anti-osteoporosis botanicals for promoting bone growth, was examined in this study. The effects of Drynol Cibotin on cell growth, apoptosis, cell spreading, calcium uptake and production of bone matrix proteins Collagen I and Laminin B2 on human osteoblast cells were assessed by BrdU incorporation, TUNEL assay, cell staining, intracellular Ca2+ measurement and Western blot analysis. The results showed that Drynol Cibotin significantly increased cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in osteoblasts (P < 0.01). In addition, Drynol Cibotin was found to promote cell spreading and greatly increase calcium uptake both instantaneously and in the long term (P < 0.01). Furthermore, Drynol Cibotin significantly increased production of two key extracellular matrix proteins in bone cells: Collagen I and Laminin B2. These results indicate that Drynol Cibotin alone or in combination with amino acids and vitamins may have prophylactic potentials in osteoporosis.",

We determined the ability of Danggui and Yimucao herb pair (DY) to regulate the Th1/Th2 paradigm by detecting the level of progesterone in the serum and the expression of T-bet and GATA-3 in the spleen and uterus. Then, we detected the level of metabolites in the serum and enriched multiple metabolic pathways. The arachidonic acid pathway can directly regulate the differentiation of Th1/Th2 cells.

            "content": "Lignin is a highly complex phenolic polymer which is essential for plants, but also makes it difficult for industrial processing. Engineering lignin by introducing relatively labile linkages into the lignin backbone can render it more amenable to chemical depolymerization. It has been reported that introducing a feruloyl-coenzyme A monolignol transferase from Angelica sinensis (AsFMT) into poplar could incorporate monolignol ferulate conjugates (ML-FAs) into lignin polymers, suggesting a promising way to manipulate plants for readily deconstructing. FMT catalyzes a reaction between monolignols and feruloyl-CoA to produce ML-FAs and free CoA-SH. However, the mechanisms of substrate specificity and catalytic process of FMT remains poorly understood. Here we report the structure of AsFMT, which adopts a typical fold of BAHD acyltransferase family. Structural comparisons with other BAHD homologs reveal several unique structural features of AsFMT, different from those of the BAHD homologs. Further molecular docking studies showed that T375 in AsFMT may function as an oxyanion hole to stabilize the reaction intermediate and also proposed a role of H278 in the binding of the nucleophilic hydroxyl group of monolignols. Together, this study provides important structural insights into the reactions catalyzed by AsFMT and will shed light on its future application in lignin engineering.",

Hence, we investigated LIG's effect on GBM T98G cells. The study shows that LIG can significantly reduce T98G cells' migration in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the attenuation of cellular mobility can be linked to the activity of the Rho GTPases (RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42), the three critical molecular switches governing cytoskeleton remodeling; thus, regulating cell migration. LIG significantly reduces the expression of RhoA and affects in a milder manner the expression of Cdc42 and Rac1.",

            "content": "Despite numerous in vitro/vivo and phytochemical studies, the active constituents of Angelica sinensis (AS) have not been conclusively identified for the standardization to bioactive markers. Phytochemical analyses of AS extracts and fractions that demonstrate activity in a panel of in vitro bioassays, have repeatedly pointed to ligustilide as being (associated with) the active principle(s). Due to the chemical instability of ligustilide and related issues in GC/LC analyses, new methods capable of quantifying ligustilide in mixtures that do not rely on an identical reference standard are in high demand. This study demonstrates how NMR can satisfy the requirement for simultaneous, multi-target quantification and qualitative identification. First, the AS activity was concentrated into a single fraction by RP-solid-phase extraction, as confirmed by an alkaline phosphatase, (anti-)estrogenicity and cytotoxicity assay. Next, a quantitative (1)H NMR (qHNMR) method was established and validated using standard compounds and comparing processing methods. Subsequent 1D/2D NMR and qHNMR analysis led to the identification and quantification of ligustilide and other minor components in the active fraction, and to the development of quality criteria for authentic AS preparations. The absolute and relative quantities of ligustilide, six minor alkyl phthalides, and groups of phenylpropanoids, polyynes, and poly-unsaturated fatty acids were measured by a combination of qHNMR and 2D COSY. The qNMR approach enables multi-target quality control of the bioactive fraction, and enables the integrated biological and chemical standardization of AS botanicals. This methodology can potentially be transferred to other botanicals with active principles that act synergistically, or that contain closely related and/or constituents, which have not been conclusively identified as the active principles.",

A total of 90 adult male Kunming mice were divided into the following 6 groups: Control (no intervention), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; received only DMSO), cyclosporine A (CsA), clomifene citrate (CC; CsA + CC, 15 mg/kg/day), WSSJD (CsA + WSSJD, crude drug 12 g/kg/day) and new WSSJD (CsA + new WSSJD, crude drug 12 g/kg/day). All mice were treated for 30 days via oral gavage. The testes were subsequently fixed and stained with hematoxylin & eosin to assess the development of seminiferous epithelia. Immunohistochemical techniques were used to detect the expression of luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) and P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc) in testicular Leydig cells. In addition, the apoptosis of spermatogenic cells in the testes was detected using a terminal dexynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay, and flow cytometry was used to analyze the survival rate and early apoptosis of sperm in the epididymis. Compared with the CsA and CC groups, new WSSJD administration significantly increased levels of serum testosterone and the expressions of LHR and P450scc in testicular Leydig cells (P<0.05), while the apoptosis of spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules and early apoptosis of mature sperm were significantly decreased (P<0.05). These results suggest that new WSSJD may ameliorate CsA-induced spermatogenic damage in male mice by enhancing testosterone synthesis and the secretion of testicular Leydig cells, and by reducing the apoptosis of spermatogenic cells.",

A total of six hydroxylation metabolites and nine GSH conjugates were tentatively identified characterized. The metabolic pathways included hydroxylation, dehydrogenation and GSH conjugation. M6 was the major metabolite in human liver microsomes. CYP1A2 (25%), 2B6 (31.6%), 2C9 (10.5%) and 3A4 (18%) were the predominant isoenzymes governing its formation. This study provides valuable information on the in vitro metabolism of neocnidilide, which is indispensable for the further safety assessment of this compound.",

Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that DBT could be readily distinguished from the water extracts of its constituent herbs by the metabolic profiles. More interestingly, the metabolic profile of DBT was not a simple sum of that of AR and ASR. Asparagine was found at significantly higher concentration in DBT than that in either AR or ASR extract, contributing mainly to the discrimination of DBT sample. In addition, we employed the same method to profile a commercial DBT powder, verifying its authenticity as compared to our prepared DBT.

According to the set of analytes under research, Monte-Carlo simulations were conducted based on these retention models to estimate the probability of achieving adequate separations between all the analytes and their interferences. Then the analytical parameters were mathematically optimised to the point giving a high value of this probability to compose a robust HPLC method. Radix Angelica Sinensis (RAS) and its TCM formula with Folium Epimedii (FE) were taken as the complicated samples for case studies.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The retention models for the compounds in RAS and FE were built independently with correlation coefficients all above 0.9799.

The three potential TCM candidates identified as having suitable docking conformations and bioactivity profiles were Angeliferulate, (3R)-2'-hydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxyisoflavan-7-O-beta-D-glucoside (HMID), and 3-[2',6-dihydroxy-5'-(2-propenyl)[1,1'-biphenyl]3-yl]-(E)-2-propenoic acid (3PA). Molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated that the TCM candidates have more stable interactions with the cleft and in complex with Src kinase compared to Saracatinib. Angeliferulate and HMID, both originated from Angelica sinensis, not only interact with Lys298 and amino acids from different loops in the cleft, but also with Asp407 located on the activation loop. These interactions are important to reduce the opening of the activation loop due to phosphorylation, hence stabilize the Src kinase cleft structure and inhibit activation. The TCM candidates also exhibited high affinity to other cancer-related target proteins (EGFR, HER2, and HSP90). Our observations suggest that the TCM candidates might have multi-targeting effects in hypertension and cancer.",

Despite advances in understanding fibrosis pathology and clinical management, there is no treatment for fibrosis that can prevent or reverse it, existing treatment options may lead to diarrhea, nausea, bleeding, anorexia, and liver toxicity. Thus, effective drugs are needed for fibrotic diseases. Traditional Chinese medicine has played a vital role in fibrotic diseases, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that Astragalus (Astragalus mongholicus Bunge) can attenuate multiple fibrotic diseases, which include liver fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, peritoneal fibrosis, renal fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, and so on, mechanisms may be related to inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), reactive oxygen species (ROS), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1)/Smads, apoptosis, inflammation pathways. The purpose of this review was to summarize the pharmacology and mechanisms of Astragalus in treating fibrotic diseases, the data reviewed demonstrates that Astragalus is a promising anti-fibrotic drug, its main anti-fibrotic components are Calycosin, Astragaloside IV, Astragalus polysaccharides and formononetin. We also review formulas that contain Astragalus with anti-fibrotic effects, in which Astragalus and Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, Astragalus and Angelica sinensis (Oliv.)

Studies have focused on the treatment of inflammatory diseases and pain using ferulic acid. However, little is known about its pharmacokinetics after transdermal administration. The present research investigated the pharmacokinetic behavior of ferulic acid in rat plasma and skin microdialysate after ferulic acid transdermal or intragastric administration. Samples collected at predetermined time points were determined by a simple and sensitive HPLC-UV method. The pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using non-compartmental analysis with DAS 2.0 software. The values of AUC0-t and Cmax after intragastric administration (20 mg/kg) in plasma were 281.47 ± 46.76 min mg/L and 12.20 ± 2.46 mg/L, respectively. After emulsion transdermal administration (117 mg/kg, 35 mg/4 cm2), the values of AUC0-t and Cmax in plasma and skin microdialysate were 953.90 ± 175.30 min mg/L, 7630.47 ± 1410.33 min mg/L, 3.00 ± 0.61 mg/L, and 19.08 ± 4.39 mg/L, respectively.

            "content": "Autophagy plays a pro-survival role in the tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. Herein we found that autophagy was concomitantly induced in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7TR5) cells through the dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin 1 and subsequent enhancement of interaction among the ATG14-Beclin1-PI3KC3 complex. Moreover, higher level of DNA damage was observed in MCF-7TR5 cells with the decreased BRCA1 and RAD51 level and the increased Ku80 level. Interestingly, Nur77 was selectively degraded by autophagy, which causes the release of Ku80 from the Nur77-Ku80 complex, resulting in the increase of the DNA binding of Ku80 and DNA-PKcs. Meanwhile, Z-ligustilide, a phthalide compound from Radix Angelica sinensis, was shown to inhibit the autophagic flux by blocking the autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Importantly, Z-ligustilide-mediated autophagy inhibition restored Nur77 expression in MCF-7TR5 cells. Furthermore, Z-ligustilide promoted the interaction of Nur77 with Ku80 and thereby abolished the association of DNA-PKcs with DNA ends. Moreover, Z-ligustilide sensitized MCF-7TR5 cells in a caspase-independent cell death and enhanced the DNA damage caused by tamoxifen, which was found to be attenuated by shNur77. Together, these findings not only provide important insights into the formation of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells, but also suggest Z-ligustilide may function as a novel autophagy inhibitor to overcome chemoresistance.",

            "content": "Ligustilide is widely thought to be the most potent bioactive constituent of Angelica sinensis. We have previously reported the role of ligustilide in preventing TNF-α-induced apoptosis and identified the presence of autophagosome clusters. Then, we hypothesised that autophagy may contribute to muscle loss and that ligustilide could protect cell fibres by regulating the autophagic process. The aim of this study was to identify the effects of ligustilide on autophagy regulation during cell differentiation in the presence of TNF-α. We then observed intracellular morphologic changes and autophagosome formation using transmission electron microscopy. LC3B expression was assessed by immunofluorescence and Atg-7, Atg-5, Atg-12 and LC3B expression levels were detected by western blot. The results revealed a reduction in the number of TNF-α-induced autophagosomes after ligustilide treatment accompanied by a decrease in Atg-7, Atg-5, Atg-12 and LC3B expression, as well as a reduction of the LC3BII/I ratio in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings provide evidence supporting a protective effect of ligustilide against TNF-α-induced autophagy during myotubes formation.",

Suckling rabbits were challenged with 1.5 × 10(7) colony forming unit (CFU) of S. aureus at the base of the third pair teats, and they were treated and pretreated with JYT to detect the formula effects. The results showed that JYT could reduce the occurrence of Staphylococcal mastitis in rabbit model. To further investigate the action mechanism of JYT, we examined the leukocyte counts and inflammatory mediator levels such as TNF-α and IL-6 in blood and infected tissue. From histological study and blood analysis, we found that JYT could suppress leukocyte infiltration in infected mammary gland tissue and significantly inhibit the total leukocyte counts and lymphocytes (LYM), monocytes (MON) and granulocytes (GRA) fractions of leukocyte counts in blood. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results showed JYT significantly decreased the TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations in serum and mammary gland.

Herbal medicine has long been used in chronic liver disease but there is little scientific evidence for their actions. The present study investigated the effects of 14 commonly used herbs on cellular proliferation and apoptosis of a rat hepatic stellate cell line, HSC-T6 and the underlying mechanism of herb-induced apoptosis. HSC-T6 cell were incubated with herbal extracts and their proliferation was assessed by colorimetric assay. Apoptosis was measured and confirmed by flow cytometry, terminal transferase uridyl nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and morphological features in hematoxylin and eosin staining. Apoptotic pathways involving Fas receptor and Bcl-2 family were investigated by Western blot. Five herbs, namely Angelica sinensis (AS), Carthamus tinctorius (CT), Ligusticum chuanxiong (LC), Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM) and Stephania tetrandra (ST) demonstrated both anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities in HSC-T6. The highest potency was detected in SM and ST with 51.63 and 44.52% of HSC-T6 showing apoptotic changes, respectively. This was associated with upregulation of Fas and Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-xL in HSC. Fas ligand and Bcl2 expressions remained unchanged.

However, there have been no reports about the effects of SWE on gut barrier damage. Therefore, the aim of the study was to explore the effect of SWE on gut barrier damage. In this study, we found that SWE effectively controlled body weight, liver weight, and feed efficiency, as well as decreased the serum TC level in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, SWE and rosiglitazone (Ros, positive control) increased the colonic alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level, down-regulated serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and reduced intestinal permeability. In addition, SWE increased goblet cell numbers and mucus layer thickness to strengthen the mucus barrier. After supplementation with SWE and rosiglitazone, the protein expression of CHOP and GRP78 displayed a decrease, which improved the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress condition. Meanwhile, the increase in Cosmc and C1GALT1 improved the O-glycosylation process for correct protein folding. These results collectively demonstrated that SWE improved the mucus barrier, focusing on Muc2 mucin expression, in a prolonged high-fat diet, and provides evidence for the potential of SWE in the treatment of intestinal disease-associated mucus barrier damage.",

To this end, we isolated eleven ligustilide dimers (1-11) from A. sinensis and examined the molecular mechanism of their nephroprotective effects.,Main methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Because of internal RAS playing an important role in CKD, we used renin expression as a target and screened preliminarily for antifibrotic effects of ligustilide dimers (1-11) by constructing a dual luciferase reporter gene in vitro. Furthermore, the reno-protective effects of the ligustilides and their underlying mechanism were investigated in TGF-β1-stimulated HK-2 cells and 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx) mice.,Key findings:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The ligustilide dimers exhibited anti-fibrotic effects by inhibiting human renin (hREN) promoter activity to decrease renin expression and down-regulate the expression of fibrosis-related factors, including α-SMA, collagen I, and fibronectin in vitro. Levistolide A (LA) and angeolide keto ester (AK) were screened out to identify their ability and underlying mechanism for treating CKD. Experimental validation further indicated that LA or AK treatment inhibited the expression of key molecules in RAS, TGF-β1/Smad, and MAPK pathways to downregulate ECM deposition.

Aromatic drugs have been widely used to relieve symptoms of depression with fewer side effects. Ligustilide (LIG) is the main component of volatile oil in angelica sinensis, exhibiting an excellent anti-depressive effect. However, the mechanisms of the anti-depressive effect of LIG remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the mechanisms of LIG exerting an anti-depressive effect. We obtained 12,969 depression-related genes and 204 LIG targets by a network pharmacology approach, which were intersected to get 150 LIG anti-depressive targets. Then, we identified core targets by MCODE, including MAPK3, EGF, MAPK14, CCND1, IL6, CASP3, IL2, MYC, TLR4, AKT1, ESR1, TP53, HIF1A, SRC, STAT3, AR, IL1B, and CREBBP. Functional enrichment analysis of core targets showed a significant association with PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. Molecular docking showed strong affinities of LIG with AKT1, MAPK14, and ESR1. Finally, we validated the interactions between these proteins and LIG by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In conclusion, this study successfully predicted that LIG exerted an anti-depressive effect through multiple targets, including AKT1, MAPK14, and ESR1, and the pathways of PI3K/AKT and MAPK. The study provides a new strategy to explore the molecular mechanisms of LIG in treating depression.",

Due to its high morbidity, high mortality, high recurrence rate, and low cure rate, it has brought great difficulty for treatment. Although the current treatment is multimodal, including surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, it does not significantly improve survival time. The dismal prognosis and inevitable recurrence as well as resistance to chemoradiotherapy may be related to its highly cellular heterogeneity and multiple subclonal populations. Traditional Chinese medicine has its own unique advantages in the prevention and treatment of it. A comprehensive literature search of anti-glioblastoma active ingredients and derivatives from traditional Chinese medicine was carried out in literature published in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science Cochrane library, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP database. Hence, this article systematically reviews experimental research progress of some traditional Chinese medicine in treatment of glioblastoma from two aspects: strengthening vital qi and eliminating pathogenic qi.

            "content": "Phytoestrogens are plant constituents that possess either estrogenic or antiestrogenic activity. Although their activities are weak as compared with human endogenous estrogens, the consumption of phytoestrogens may have clinically significant consequences. A number of botanicals, or the compounds contained therein, have been identified as putative estrogenic agents, but consensus in the biomedical community has been hampered by conflicting data from various in vitro and in vivo models of estrogenic activity. Phytoestrogens may serve as chemopreventive agents while at the same time being capable of promoting growth in estrogen receptor positive cancer cell lines. Furthermore, they may exert their estrogenic influence through receptor-dependent and/or receptor-independent mechanisms. These findings have led to speculation that phytoestrogen intake might be ill advised for patients at an increased risk for hormone-dependent cancers, cancer patients, or cancer survivors. This article will attempt to sort out discrepancies between various experimental models and establish whether certain herbs possess estrogenic activity. The review will focus on 5 popular botanical dietary supplements: Trifolium pratense (red clover), Cimicifuga racemosa (black cohosh), Humulus lupulus (hops), Angelica sinensis (dong quai), and Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice). It will address their mechanisms of action, clinical evidence bases, and implications for use in cancer.",

            "content": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent abnormally elevated blood sugar levels. T2DM affects millions of people and exerts a significant global public health burden. Danggui Buxue decoction (DBD), a classical Chinese herbal formula composed of Astragalus membranaceus (Huangqi) and Angelica sinensis (Danggui), has been widely used in the clinical treatment of diabetes and its complications. However, the effect of DBD on the gut microbiota of individuals with diabetes and its metabolism are still poorly understood. In this study, a T2DM model was established in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, which were then treated with a clinical dose of DBD (4 g/kg) through tube feeding for 6 weeks. Next, we used 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to detect changes in the composition of the microbiota and cecal metabolic products. Our data show that DBD mediates the continuous increase in blood glucose in GK rats, improves insulin sensitivity, reduces expression of inflammatory mediators, and improves systemic oxidative stress. Moreover, DBD also improves microbial diversity (e.g., Romboutsia, Firmicutes, and Bacilli) in the intestines of rats with T2DM. Further, DBD intervention also regulates various metabolic pathways in the gut microbiota, including alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. In addition, arginine biosynthesis and the isoflavone biosynthesis may be a unique mechanism by which DBD exerts its effects. Taken together, we show that DBD is a promising therapeutic agent that can restore the imbalance found in the gut microbiota of T2DM rats. DBD may modify metabolites in the microbiota to realize its antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory effects.",

The dataset also incorporates species documented in a literature survey of alien plants used for traditional medicines in South Africa. The species inventory is a consolidation of the data from two separate investigations of 106 medicinal plant traders: firstly, a study conducted in 2010/2011 of 77 traders in markets and shops in Johannesburg, Pretoria and Durban (Williams et al., 2021); and secondly, a study conducted in 2017/2018 of plants sold by 29 (im)migrant traders of West African, East African, and Indian origin in Johannesburg, and of alien species listed in a TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) catalogue (Burness, 2019). Accompanying each plant photograph in the photo-guide is the following information: species name; common name(s) provided by the survey respondents; invasive alien plant category; introduction status; voucher specimen number(s); nationality of the medicine traders; and, notes on source localities (e.g. imported or collected in southern Africa). Overall, most of the taxa were from the Asteraceae (12%), Fabaceae (9%) and Poaceae (5%). The species are mostly unlisted (76%) with respect to their legal status in South Africa in terms of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEM:BA), 2004 Alien & Invasive Species (A&IS) regulations.

Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5'-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells.",

The depressed patients were screened according to the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorder (CCMD-3) and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). In addition, five other depressed patients were also enrolled as the primary cohort when the final step of sample collection was conducted. Plasma samples were analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Clinical and metabolomics data were analyzed by multivariate statistics analysis, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and MetaboAnalyst.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      We observed significant differences between depression cohort and healthy volunteers, and between patients before and after the treatment of XYS. The method was then clinically validated in an independent validation cohort. Levels of oxalic and stearic acids significantly increased in depressed patients' plasma while valine and urea significantly decreased, as compared with healthy controls. Of note, XYS reversed these metabolite changes in terms of regulating dysfunctions in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, and arginine and proline metabolism. Importantly, the combination of oxalic and stearic acids is in prospect as diagnose biomarkers.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      This study highlights the clinical application of metabolomics in disease diagnose and therapy evaluation, which will help in improving our understanding of depression and will lay solid foundation for the clinic application of TCMs. In addition, it suggests that the combination of the two potential biomarkers had also achieved a high diagnostic value, which consequently could be used a diagnose biomarkers.",

A pure compound butylidenephthalide (BP), isolated from Angelica sinensis, has been shown the activities to arrest the growth and initiate apoptosis of GBM in our previous reports. In this study, we further demonstrated that BP treatment accelerates the cell senescence in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), a proto-oncogene, is generally upregulated in cancer. We found that it was downregulated in BP-treated GBM cells. The downregulation of Skp2 is parallel with increasing p16 and p21 expression which causes G0/G1 arrest and tumor cell senescence. We also found that restoring the Skp2 protein level by exogenous overexpression prevents the BP-induced cell senescence. Therefore, the linkage between cell senescence and Skp2 expression is strengthened. Promoter binding analysis further detailed that the BP-mediated SP1 reduction might involve in the Skp2 downregulation. In summary, these results emphasize that BP-triggered senescence in GBM cells is highly associated with its control on Skp2 regulation.",

Separation of 36 components from 12 batches of FZS was performed on a C(18) column, with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.1% acetic acid-water, with gradient elution at a column temperature of 30 degrees C. The optimum detection wavelength was set at 335 nm, the drift tube temperature of ELSD was set at 80 degrees C, the carrier gas pressure was 25 psi, and the gain = 10. The similarity among 12 batches of FZS was over 0.95. Five constituents of FZS, namely baicalin, ferulic acid, and ginsenosides Rg(1), Re, and Rb(1), were identified based on their retention times (RT). Calibration curves for baicalin and ginsenoside Rb1 showed good linearity (r (2) > 0.9992); recoveries ranged from 95% to 99%. This quantification method is reproducible and simple, and may provide a tool to assess the quality of FZS.",

Antioxidants that protect the tubular epithelium and anti-fibrotics that induce apoptosis of pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts without adversely affecting tubular epithelium may slow progression of renal fibrosis, while toxic substances may exacerbate renal scarring. We investigated 47 herbs for their in vitro toxic or antioxidant effects on normal renal mammalian fibroblasts (NRK49F) and tubular epithelial cells (NRK52E) to determine their potential value as therapeutic agents in renal fibrosis involving oxidative stress.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Herbs were chosen because of their traditional use in kidney or urinary system disorders, or because of recent published interest in their therapeutic or toxic potential in kidney disease. Extracts of herbs were made using a sequential multi-solvent extraction process. Each extract was analysed separately. Extraction solvents were ethyl acetate, methanol and 50% aqueous methanol. Cells were treated with extracts with/without oxidative stress (1.0 mM hydrogen peroxide). Cellular changes (apoptosis, necrosis, mitosis, transdifferentiation) were identified and quantified using defined criteria.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      All extracts of Dioscorea villosa showed significant toxicity to both cell lines.

            "content": "In order to investigate the biochemical mechanism of Dang-Gui Buxue Tang (DBT) involved in its cardioprotective action, the effects of DBT and related preparations on the cellular level of reduced glutathione (GSH) and on susceptibility to menadione-induced toxicity were examined in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Treatment with herbal extract prepared from the fresh root of Astragalus membranaceus (RAM) or Angelica sinensis (RAS) alone and their combinations (D1:1-D10:1) in varying ratios of RAM to RAS (1:1 to 10:1, respectively) increased cellular GSH in a concentration-dependent manner, with the effect produced by the D5:1 extract, an authentic formula of DBT, being the most potent. The enhancement of cellular GSH was found to correlate positively with the degree of cytoprotection against menadione toxicity. Both GSH-enhancing and cytoprotective effects of DBT were largely abolished by GSH depletion as a result of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)/phorone treatment. The DBT-induced increase in the cellular GSH level and the associated cytoprotection were also suppressed by the treatment with BSO, an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, or 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, an inhibitor of GSH regeneration. The results indicate that DBT treatment protects against oxidant injury in H9c2 cells, and that the cytoprotective action is causally related to the increase in cellular GSH level, which is likely mediated by the enhancement of GSH synthesis and regeneration.",

PCOS affects women of growing age particularly at the early to late reproductive stage (15-35 years). Currently, PCOS affects 1 in every 10 women worldwide. It is characterized majorly by a raised level of androgens such as testosterone and a large number of ovarian cysts (more than 10) that cause anovulation, infertility, and irregular menstrual cycle. PCOS is also related to other endocrine and metabolic abnormalities, such as obesity, hirsutism, acne, diabetes, insulin resistance, and glucose impairment. PCOS can be treated with allopathic, ayurvedic, and natural or herbal medications along with lifestyle modifications. Herbal medicines remained in demand for numerous reasons such as high cost and side effects associated with the use of allopathic medicine and our traditional norms, which have helped humans to use more herbal products for their health benefits. Estrogenic and nonestrogenic phytochemicals present in various plant species such as Glycyrrhiza glabra L. [Fabaceae], Aloe vera (L.) Burm. f. [Asphodelaceae], Silybum marianum (L.). Gaertn.

            "content": "Introduction: Tamoxifen (TAM) is the most commonly used hormone therapeutic drug for the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. 30%-70% of clinical breast cancer patients use natural products, which may increase the likelihood of drug interactions. Objective: To evaluate the evidence for the interactions between natural products and TAM in breast cancer. Methods: Electronic databases, including PubMed, CINAHL Plus (via EbscoHost), European PMC, Medline, and Google Scholar, were searched for relevant publications. The search terms include complementary and alternative medicine, natural products, plant products, herbs, interactions, tamoxifen, breast cancer, and their combinations. Results: Various in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the combined use of natural products with TAM produced synergistic anti-cancer effects, including improved inhibition of tumor cell growth and TAM sensitivity and reduced side effects or toxicity of TAM. In contrast, some natural products, including Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels [Apiaceae], Paeonia lactiflora Pall., Rehmannia glutinosa (Gaertn.) DC., Astragalus mongholicus Bunge, and Glycyrrhiza glabra L. [Fabaceae], showed estrogen-like activity, which may reduce the anti-cancer effect of TAM. Some natural products, including morin, silybin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), myricetin, baicalein, curcumin, kaempferol, or quercetin, were found to increase the bioavailability of TAM and its metabolites in vivo. However, three are limited clinical studies on the combination of natural products and TAM. Conclusion: There is evidence for potential interactions of various natural products with TAM in pre-clinical studies, although the relevant clinical evidence is still lacking. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the potential interactions of natural products with TAM in clinical settings.",

            "content": "Aging can lead to the occurrence of many degenerative diseases, and the most intuitive consequences are mainly manifested on the skin, which is affected by both endogenous and exogenous aging factors and can be used as an ideal model organ for studying aging. 4,4'-Dimethoxychalcone (DMC), a natural flavonoid compound from Angelica sinensis, has been proven to prolong the lifespan of multiple species. However, it is not clear whether it has the effect of delaying skin aging. This study aimed to establish a skin senescent cell model induced by oxidative stress, and further, to analyze the inhibitory effect of DMC on cellular senescence, and explore its molecular mechanisms. We found that treatment of HaCaT cells with 1 mM 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH) for 48 h showed significant senescent characteristics, which could be effectively alleviated by pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). DMC significantly inhibited AAPH-induced senescence, and further mechanism studies showed that the activation of autophagy which depended on the phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser555 was necessary for DMC to alleviate senescence of HaCaT cells. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway was also involved in the regulation of autophagy induced by DMC. These results were also validated in UVB-induced photoaging mice. In conclusion, we successfully establish a skin senescent cell model and prove that DMC can be used as a potential therapeutic agent to intervene in skin aging.",

Our research focuses on how to reduce the cardiac toxicity caused by oxidative stress through natural plant extracts.

Experimental studies have provided evidence for this compound's effectiveness in cardiovascular diseases; however, its mechanism is still unclear. In this study, molecular mechanisms related to the protective effects of VA were investigated in H9c2 cells in the context of H/R injury. The results showed that pretreatment with VA significantly increased cell viability and decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells, as well as lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase activity, in the supernatant, accompanied by reduced levels of reactive oxygen species and reduced caspase-3 activity. VA pretreatment also restored mitochondrial membrane potentials. Moreover, preincubation with VA significantly attenuated mitochondrial permeability transition pore activity. VA administration upregulated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase α2 (AMPKα2) protein expression, and interestingly, pretreatment with AMPKα2-siRNA lentivirus effectively attenuated the cardioprotective effects of VA in response to H/R injury.",

Numerous health benefits have been attributed to FA, but few studies have investigated the effects of FA on osteoblasts (Obs). Our work studied the effects of FA on proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of rat calvarial Obs and examined the signaling pathways involved. Cell proliferation and differentiation were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay kit, respectively. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase II (PKGII) expression was silenced by small interfering RNA (siRNA). The mRNA expression was investigated by semi-quantitative PCR. FA (40-2560 μM) promoted Ob proliferation and differentiation; at 40-640 μM, FA stimulated calcified nodule formation and increased the expression of osteogenic genes encoding osteopontin and collagen-l. FA (40-2560 μM) increased cGMP levels in Obs and upregulated the expression of PKGII, EnaCα, and ENaCγ mRNAs. Downregulated ENaCα mRNA expression in Obs transfected with the siRNA for PKGII was reversed when FA was introduced into Obs. These results demonstrated that FA promoted proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of Obs in vitro, and enhanced osteogenic genes expression partly through the cGMP-PKGII-ENaC signaling pathway.",

A Chinese herbal formula composed of Poria cocos (Chinese name: Fu Ling), Atractylodes macrocephala (Chinese name: Bai Zhu) and Angelica sinensis (Chinese names: Danggui, Dong quai, Donggui; Korean name: Danggwi) (FBD), has been proved to be beneficial in the treatment of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R).This study was carried out to evaluate the protective effect of FBD against neuronal oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro. Rat I/R were established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 h, followed by 24 h reperfusion. MCAO led to significant depletion in superoxide dismutase and glutathione and rise in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and nitric oxide in brain. The neurological deficit and brain infarction were also significantly elevated by MCAO as compared with sham-operated group. All the brain oxidative stress and damage were significantly attenuated by 7 days pretreatment with the aqueous extract of FBD (250 mg kg(-1), p.o.). Moreover, cerebrospinal fluid sampled from FBD-pretreated rats protected PC12 cells against oxidative insult induced by 0.2 mM hydrogen peroxide, in a concentration and time-dependent manner (IC(50) 10.6%, ET(50) 1.2 h). However, aqueous extract of FBD just slightly scavenged superoxide anion radical generated in xanthine-xanthine oxidase system (IC(50) 2.4 mg ml(-1)) and hydroxyl radical generated in Fenton reaction system (IC(50) 3.6 mg ml(-1)). In conclusion, FBD was a distinct antioxidant phytotherapy to rescue neuronal oxidative stress, through blocking LPO, restoring endogenous antioxidant system, but not scavenging free radicals.",

Plant-derived oils evaluated were Thymus vulgaris (thyme), Gaultheria procumbens (wintergreen), Glycyrrhiza uralensis (Chinese licorice), Angelica sinensis, and Angelica dahurica. Broth dilution testing according to standard protocol was performed using ultrapasteurized whole milk instead of broth. Controls included milk only (negative control), milk + bacteria (positive control), and milk + bacteria + penicillin-streptomycin (antibiotic control, at 1 and 5% concentrations). Essential oil of thyme was tested by itself and not in combination with other oils because of its known antibacterial activity. The other plant-derived oils were tested alone and in combination for a total of 15 treatments, each replicated 3 times and tested at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4% to simulate concentrations potentially achievable in the milk within the pre-dry-off udder quarter. Thyme oil at concentrations ≥2% completely inhibited bacterial growth in all replications. Other plant-derived oils tested alone or in various combinations were not consistently antibacterial and did not show typical dose-response effects. Only thyme essential oil had consistent antibacterial activity against the 3 mastitis-causing organisms tested in vitro. Further evaluation of physiological effects of thyme oil in various preparations on mammary tissue is recommended to determine potential suitability for mastitis therapy.",

            "content": "Huang Qi (root of Astragalus membranaceus) and Dang Gui ( Angelica sinensis), two of the most widely used herbs in traditional Chinese medicine, have been proven to be effective in the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM) although the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated. This study was designed to investigate the protective effect of Dang Gui and Huang Qi mixture (GQM) on the development of diabetic nephropathy in rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DM and the possible underlying molecular mechanism. The diabetic animal model was made by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ and then treated with GQM or benazepril. Blood glucose, triglyceride (TG), cholesterol (CHO), high density lipoprotein (HDL), serum creatinine (Scr), creatinine clearance rate (Ccr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine beta (2)-microglobin (beta (2)-MG), kidney/body weight (K/B) ratio, glomerular area (GA), renal transforming growth factor-beta (1) (TGF-beta (1)) mRNA expression and blood and renal angiotensin II (AngII) expression were determined 8 weeks after the treatment. The blood glucose, CHO and TG levels, BUN, SCr, Ccr. K/B ratio, GA, the excretion of beta (2)-MG, renal TGF-beta (1) mRNA expression and blood and renal AngII expression were significantly increased while the HDL level was decreased 8 week after STZ injection. The changes in blood glucose, TG, CHO and HDL were reversed by GQM, not by benazepril, whereas the changes in other variables were reversed by both GQM and benazepril. Our results suggest that GQM alleviates the disorder in blood glucose and lipids, protects against the progression of renal nephropathy in diabetic rats, probably by inhibiting the expression of AngII and TGF-beta (1) mRNA.",

The main active components of Shunaoxin pills are ferulic acid and ligustilide from Chuanxiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort, Umbelliferae) and Danggui (Angelica sinensis radix, Umbelliferae). As Shunaoxin shows excellent activity in the central nervous system (CNS), the extent to which the major constituents of Shunaoxin reach the CNS should be investigated. Moreover, the in vivo-in vitro correlations (IVIVC) of the formulation should be studied to elucidate the mechanisms of action of TCM in the CNS. However, these data have not previously been available. Thus we intended to investigate what the extent when these constituents of Shunaoxin pills reach the CNS, and evaluate the IVIVC of release and pharmacokinetics.,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      In this study, we evaluated the release of ferulic acid and ligustilide from Shunaoxin pills, and their transport across an in vitro model of the BBB. We also evaluated their pharmacokinetics and brain distribution in vivo. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify both compounds simultaneously.

            "content": "Phthalides are a relatively small group of natural compounds confined to several plant families and some genera of fungi and liverworts. They are divided into two structural groups, the monomeric and dimeric phthalides, and known mainly as bioactive constituents of different plant species used traditionally for medicinal purposes in Asia, Europe, and North America.The first reports on the chemistry of phthalides appeared at the end of the nineteenth century, in which they were identified as the odor constituents of the essential oil of celery (Apium graveolens) by Ciamician and Silber (1897). In the first half of the last century, phthalides were isolated from Cnidium officinale and Ligusticum acutilobum, species widely used in Asian traditional medicine, and from Levisticum officinale, a species used as food and condiment. Throughout the second part of the twentieth century, phthalides have been characterized from several plant families, namely Asteraceae, Leguminosae, Orchidaceae and Rutaceae, among others, but mainly from the Umbelliferae (syn Apiaceae) family, and the major contributors have been the following species used in traditional medicine: Ligusticum chuanxiong (Chinese name: Chuanxiong), Angelica sinensis (Chinese name: Danggui), Cnidium officinale (Japanese name: Senkyu), Angelica acutiloba (Japanese name: Toki), and Ligusticum porteri (Hispanic name: Oshá). Phthalides are also constituents of several genera of fungi, such as Penicillium, Alternaria and Pestalotiopsis, and some liverworts.Different chromatographic, spectrometric, and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques have been used for the isolation and structural characterization of phthalides in extracts, and for assessing the quality of plant material containing this type of compound. Isotopic labeling has established the biosynthesis of phthalides via linkage of acetate units forming polyketide intermediates.Chemical transformations of monomeric phthalides have included oxidation, reduction, addition, elimination, and cycloaddition reactions, and treatments with Lewis acids of (Z)-ligustilide have afforded linear dimers. Some intramolecular condensations and differentiated cyclizations of the dimeric phthalides have been carried out, providing evidences for the particular chemical reactivity of these compounds.Several structural modifications of phthalides have been carried out subjecting them to microbial transformations by different species of bacteria, fungi and algae, and these included resolutions of racemic mixtures and oxidations, among others.The [π4s + π2s] and [π2s + π2s] cycloadditions of (Z)-ligustilide for the synthesis of dimeric phthalides have been reported, and different approaches involving cyclizations, Alder-Rickert reactions, Sharpless asymmetric hydroxylations, or Grignard additions have been used for the synthesis of monomeric phthalides. The use of phthalides as building blocks for divergent oriented synthesis has been proven.Many of the naturally occurring phthalides display different biological activities including antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal, cytotoxic, and anti-inflammatory effects, among many others, with a considerable recent research on the topic. In the case of compounds isolated from the Apiaceae, the bioactivities correlate with the traditional medicinal uses of the natural sources. Some monomeric phthalides have shown their ability to attenuate certain neurological diseases, including stroke, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.The present contribution covers the distribution of phthalides in nature and the findings in the structural diversity, chemical reactivity, biotransformations, syntheses, and bioactivity of natural and semisynthetic phthalides.",

We demonstrated for the first time that ligustilide can significantly reduce the phenylephrine-induced aortic tension in vitro with IC(50) about 64 mug/ml, but has no in vivo effect on systolic blood pressure in SHR rats when administrated orally. The data on transport of ligustilide across Caco-2 monolayer suggested an efficient intestinal absorption of ligustilide in vivo, implying that the non-effectiveness of ligustilide in vivo is not due to the poor absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Further studies on whether ligustilide is one of the main anti-hypertensive components of the essential oil are needed.",

            "content": "Jamu is an Indonesian traditional herbal medicine that has been practiced for generations. Jamu is made from various medicinal plants. Each plant has several compounds directly related to the target protein that are directly associated with a disease. A pharmacological graph can form relationships between plants, compounds, and target proteins. Research related to the prediction of Jamu formulas for some diseases has been carried out, but there are problems in finding combinations or compositions of Jamu formulas because of the increase in search space size. Some studies adopted the drug-target interaction (DTI) implemented using machine learning or deep learning to predict the DTI for discovering the Jamu formula. However, this approach raises important issues, such as imbalanced and high-dimensional dataset, overfitting, and the need for more procedures to trace compounds to their plants. This study proposes an alternative approach by implementing bipartite graph search optimization using the branch and bound algorithm to discover the combination or composition of Jamu formulas by optimizing the search on a plant-protein bipartite graph. The branch and bound technique is implemented using the search strategy of breadth first search (BrFS), Depth First Search, and Best First Search. To show the performance of the proposed method, we compared our method with a complete search algorithm, searching all nodes in the tree without pruning. In this study, we specialize in applying the proposed method to search for the Jamu formula for type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The result shows that the bipartite graph search with the branch and bound algorithm reduces computation time up to 40 times faster than the complete search strategy to search for a composition of plants. The binary branching strategy is the best choice, whereas the BrFS strategy is the best option in this research. In addition, the the proposed method can suggest the composition of one to four plants for the T2DM Jamu formula. For a combination of four plants, we obtain Angelica Sinensis, Citrus aurantium, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, and Mangifera indica. This approach is expected to be an alternative way to discover the Jamu formula more accurately.",

            "content": "Stroke is a result of cerebral ischemia that triggers a cascade of both physiological and biochemical events. No effective treatment is available for stroke; however, stem cells have the potential to rescue tissue from the effects of stroke. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are an abundant source of adult stem cells; therefore, ADSC therapy can be considered as a future strategy for regenerative medicine. However, more research is required to improve the effectiveness of transplanted ADSCs as a treatment for stroke in the mouse stroke model. Ligustilide, isolated from the herb Angelica sinensis, exhibits a protective effect on neurons and inhibits inflammation. We also demonstrated that ligustilide treatment increases the expression levels of homing factors such as SDF-1 and CXCR4. In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of ADSC transplantation and ligustilide treatment in a mouse thromboembolic stroke model by behavioral tests, including beam walking, locomotor activity, and rotarod analysis. ADSCs pretreated with ligustilide were transplanted into the brains of stroke mice. The results showed that the therapeutic effect of ADSCs pretreated with ligustilide was better than that of ADSCs without ligustilide pretreatment. There was no difference between the recovery of mice treated by ADSC transplantation combined with subcutaneous ligustilide injection and that of mice treated only with ADSCs. The TUNEL assay showed fewer apoptotic cells in the brains of mice transplanted with ADSCs pretreated with ligustilide as well as in those without pretreatment. In summary, pretreatment of ADSCs with ligustilide improves the therapeutic efficacy of ADSC transplantation. The results of this study will help improve stem cell therapies being developed for future clinical applications.",

            "content": "Emerging evidence indicates epigenetic modification represses estrogen receptor α (ERα) and contributes to the resistance to tamoxifen in aggressive ERα-negative (ERα-) breast cancer. Z-ligustilide is a major compound in Radix Angelica sinensis, an herb from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) most frequently prescribed for breast cancer. However, the role of Z-ligustilide in ERα- breast cancer and epigenetic modification remains largely unknown. Herein we showed, for the first time, that Z-ligustilide restored the growth inhibition of tamoxifen on ERα- breast cancer cells. Apoptosis and S and G2/M phases cell cycle arrest were induced by combinatorial Z-ligustilide and tamoxifen. Importantly, Z-ligustilide reactivated the ERα expression and transcriptional activity, which is proved to be indispensable for restoring the sensitivity to tamoxifen. Interestingly, Z-ligustilide increased Ace-H3 (lys9/14) enrichment in the ERα promoter. Moreover, Z-ligustilide dramatically reduced the enrichment of metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) as well as IFN-γ-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) onto the ERα promoter. Meanwhile, Z-ligustilide downregulated MTA1, IFI16 and HDACs, which caused destabilization of the corepressor complex. Collectively, our study not only highlights Z-ligustilide as a novel epigenetic modulator, but also opens new possibilities from TCM for treating aggressive tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.",

The current study examined the putative effects of DSD on neuropathic pain.,Method:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      We used two commonly-used animal models: chronic constriction injury (CCI) and diabetic neuropathy for the study.

Meanwhile, in both models, DSD inhibited the over-expression of specific markers for microglia (Iba-1) and astroglia (GFAP) activation in the spinal dorsal horn. DSD also reduced the elevated nuclear NF-κB level and inhibited the up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, in the spinal cord.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      DSD can alleviate CCI and diabetes-induced neuropathic pain, and its effectiveness might be due to the inhibition of neuroinflammation in the spinal dorsal horn. The anti-inflammation effect of DSD may be related to the suppression of spinal NF-κB activation and/or cytokines expression. .",

            "content": "In this study, a residue analysis method for the simultaneous determination of 107 pesticides in traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), Angelica sinensis, A. dahurica, Leonurus heterophyllus Sweet, Pogostemon cablin and Lonicera japonica Thunb., was developed using gas chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in negative chemical ionisation mode (GC-NCI-MS/MS). NCI has advantages of high sensitivity and selectivity to chemicals with electron-withdrawing groups, and yields low background interference. For sample preparation, QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) was applied. Due to the unique characteristics of TCMs, the clean-up step was optimised by adjusting amounts of primary secondary amine, C18, graphitised carbon black and silica sorbents. Validation was mainly performed by determining analyte recoveries at four different spiking concentrations of 10, 50, 100 and 200 ng g(-1), with seven replicates at each concentration. Method trueness, precision, linearity of calibration curves, lowest calibrated levels (LCLs) and matrix effects were determined to demonstrate method and instrument performance. Among the 107 pesticides tested, approximately 80% gave recoveries from 80% to 110% and < 10% relative standard deviation (RSD). The LCLs for nearly all pesticides were 5 ng g(-1), and as low as 0.1 ng g(-1) for dichlofenthion, endosulfan sulphate, flumetralin, isofenphos-methyl, methyl-pentachlorophenyl sulphide and trifluralin. The results indicate that GC-NCI-MS/MS is an excellent technique for quantitative and qualitative analysis of targeted GC-amenable pesticides at ultra-trace levels, especially in complex matrices such as TCMs.",

            "content": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that causes permanent disability and mortality to approximately 1 to 100 people in the world. Patients with RA not only suffer from pain, stiffness, swelling, and loss of function in their joints, but also have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and lymphoma. Typically prescribed medications, including pain-relieving drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, can help to relieve pain, reduce inflammation and slow the course of disease progression in RA patients. However, the general effectiveness of the drugs has been far from satisfactory. Other therapeutic modalities like TNF-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors and interleukin-1 receptor antagonists targeting precise pathways within the immune system are expensive and may be associated with serious side effects. Recently, botanical medicines have become popular as alternative remedies as they are believed to be efficacious, safe and have over a thousand years experience in treating patients. In this review, we will summarize recent evidence for pharmacological effects of herbs including Black cohosh, Angelica sinensis, Licorice, Tripterygium wilfordii, Centella asiatica, and Urtica dioica. Scientific research has demonstrated that these herbs have strong anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects. A wide range of phytochemicals including phenolic acids, phenylpropanoid ester, triterpene glycosides, phthalide, flavonoids, triterpenoid saponin, diterpene and triterpene have been isolated and demonstrated to be responsible for the biological effects of the herbs. Understanding the mechanisms of action of the herbs may provide new treatment opportunities for RA patients.",

            "content": "Many Chinese therapeutic herbs that are traditionally used in combination demonstrate significantly better pharmacological effects when used in the combination than when used alone. However, the pharmacological mechanism for this synergism is still not well understood. In the present study, the antioxidant activities of six herbs ((Paeonia lactiflora (PL), Atractylodes macrocephala (AMA), Angelica sinensis (AS), Astragalus membranaceus (AME), Glycyrrhiza uralensis (GU) and Rheum officinale (RO)), which were historically combined into eight traditional Chinese herb pairs (TCHPs) (AME-AS, AME-AMA, AME-RO, AME-GU, AME-PL, PL-AS, PL-AMA and PL-GU), were investigated in vitro by assessing the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazine (DPPH)-radical scavenging abilities of the herbs. The results of this study showed that all eight TCHPs had a significantly larger scavenging capacity than would be expected from the theoretical sum of those of the respective constituent herbs (p<0.05). Furthermore, the AME-GU, AME-PL and AME-AMA pairs not only showed a significant synergistic effect in the DPPH scavenging assay, but they also demonstrated similar results in hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical anion scavenging assays. Interestingly, the AME-AMA combination had a significantly higher superoxide anion (0.2 g/ml) and hydroxyl radical scavenging ability than the AME or AMA. The changes in the total phenolic and flavonoid contents were also investigated. Our study showed a significant correlation between the rate of enhancement in antioxidant capacity and the rate of increase in flavonoid content. Thus, the flavonoids are likely responsible for the synergistic effects present in TCHPs.",

The addition of the neurotoxin could cause significant cell death and reduction of cell proliferation, as shown in the results determined by MTT assay, nitric oxide (NO) measurement and flow cytometric propidium iodine (PI) staining analysis, while pre-treatment of PC12 cell with either BFP or its main ingredients prevented the toxicity to some degree. In addition, the neurotoxin caused an elevated activation of caspase-3, the key enzyme for activation of the cellular apoptotic cascade, whereas BFP or its main ingredients inhibited the activation of caspase-3. These results strongly indicate that BFP and its main ingredients may provide a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease.",

Thus, our objectives were to determine if we could apply a molecular approach to: a) produce unique DNA profiles that are characteristic of the species, and b) determine if the geographical area or time of collection influences these DNA profiles. Towards this end, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses were performed on a number of botanicals currently used for women's health. The test materials included samples from three species each of the genera Cimicifuga (Actaea) and Trifolium, as well as samples of Vitex agnus-castus L., Glycyrrhiza glabra L., Gingko biloba L., Valeriana officinalis L., Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, Viburnum prunifolium L., Humulus lupulus L., Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait., Panax ginseng C.A. Mey. Cimicifuga racemosa (L.) Nutt. and Trifolium pratense L. are currently under clinical investigation in our basic research laboratories and medical clinic for the relief of post-menopausal symptoms. Characteristic profiles produced with the OPC-15 primer could distinguish the three Cimicifuga species: C. racemosa, C. americana and C. rubifolia. Similar results were obtained with the three Trifolium species: Trifolium pratense L., Trifolium incarnatum L., and Trifolium repens L. Accessions of cultivated T. pratense collected from the same field at different times, produced identical profiles. Accessions of Cimicifuga species collected from different geographical areas produced similar but not identical DNA profiles; however, species-specific DNA fragments were identified. These results demonstrate that RAPD analysis can be applied to distinguish species when only powdered material is available for testing. This methodology can be applied to identify species of commercial value regardless of collection time or geographic area.",

Current therapy of RA is treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Although most of these treatment methods are effective, most patients still have a pleasant experience either due to poor efficacy or side effects or both. Interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) is important in the pathogenesis of RA. In this study, we would like to detect the potential candidates which inhibit IL6R against RA from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). We use TCM compounds from the TCM Database@Taiwan for virtually screening the potential IL6R inhibitors. The TCM candidate compound, calycosin, has potent binding affinity with IL6R protein. The molecular dynamics simulation was employed to validate the stability of interaction in the protein complex with calycosin. The analysis indicates that protein complex with calycosin is more stable. In addition, calycosin is known to be one of the components of Angelica sinensis, which has been indicated to have an important role in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, calycosin is a potential candidate as lead compounds for further study in drug development process with IL6R protein against rheumatoid arthritis.",

The present study aimed to confirm the therapeutic effect of LIG administered intravenously on 2h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and 22 h reperfusion injury in rats since oral administration has low bioavailability, slow absorption and distribution. Moreover, whether LIG activated the NF-E2-related factor 2/ heme oxygenase-1 (Nrf2/HO-1) pathway was also investigated in vivo and in vitro to further elucidate the precise protective mechanisms. In vivo, rats treated intravenously with LIG immediately after the surgery was finished had less neurological dysfunction and smaller infarct volume than that of the vehicle-treated rats. Additionally, LIG promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation, and further remarkably increased Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expression. In vitro, LIG induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation and up-regulated HO-1 expression in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, LIG treatment reduced cell death induced by OGD, however, the protective action was abolished while Nrf2/HO-1 expression was knockdown by RNA interference. These results noted that intravenous post-treatment with LIG exhibits noticeable neuroprotective properties against brain damage by ischemia-reperfusion and the ability of LIG to activate Nrf2/HO-1 pathway may be partly responsible for it.",

A total of fifty-eight breast cancer patients who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy were enrolled. Immune cell levels in patient serum were determined before, and following, 6 weeks of cancer treatment for patients receiving either an RG-CMH or a placebo. Administration of RG-CMH was associated with a significant reduction in levels of leucocytes from 31·5 % for the placebo group to 13·4 % for the RG-CMH group. Similarly, levels of neutrophils significantly decreased from 35·6 % for the placebo group to 11·0 % for the RG-CMH group. RG-CMH intervention was also associated with a decrease in levels of T cells, helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells compared with the placebo group. However, these differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. In conclusion, administration of RG-CMH to patients receiving chemotherapy/radiotherapy may have the capacity to delay, or ease, the reduction in levels of leucocytes and neutrophils that are experienced by patients during cancer treatment.",

Xiaoyao San (XYS) is a well-known TCM formula for the treatment of depression by relieving \"liver qi stagnation\". This formula consists of Radix Paeoniae Alba (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.), Radix Bupleuri (Bupleurum chinense DC.), Poria (Poria cocos (Schw.)

XYS was a well-known TCM formula for the treatment of depression and liver stagnancy. However, it was still unknown whether the antidepressant effect of XYS is related to the pharmacological activity of hepatoprotection. The aim of this study was to elucidate the potential link between the antidepressant and hepatoprotective effect of XYS.,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      A depression rat model was established by the CUMS (chronic unpredictable mild stress) procedure. The antidepressant effect of XYS was assessed by the behavioral indicators, and the hepatoprotective effect of XYS was evaluated through biochemical assays. 1H-NMR and LC/MS-based liver metabolomics were performed to discover key metabolic pathways involved in the antidepressant and hepatoprotective effects of XYS. Further, the key pathway was validated using commercial kits.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The results demonstrated that XYS pretreatment could significantly improve the depressive symptom induced by CUMS. More importantly, the results demonstrated that liver injury was observed in the CUMS model rats, and XYS had a hepatoprotective effect by reducing the activities of AST and ALT in serum, increasing the levels of SOD and GSH-Px and reducing the contents of MDA, IL-6, and IL-1β in the liver. In addition, the NMR and LC/MS-based metabolomics results indicated that XYS improved 23 of the 35 perturbed potential liver biomarkers that were induced by CUMS. Among them, 9 biomarkers were significantly correlated with both depression and liver pathology, according to Pearson correlation analysis. Metabolic pathway analyses of these 9 biomarkers showed that glutamine and glutamate metabolism were the most important metabolic pathways. Furthermore, to verify glutamine and glutamate metabolism, the levels of glutamine and glutamate, and the activity of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutaminase (GLS) were quantitatively determined in the liver by commercial kits, and these results were consistent with the metabolomics results.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      XYS could significantly improve the depressive and liver injury symptoms induced by CUMS. The metabolomics results indicate that the regulation of glutamine and glutamate metabolism to maintain the balance of ammonia and promote energy metabolism is a potential junction between the antidepressant and hepatoprotective effects of XYS.",

The MGH model was established by muscular injection of E2 benzoate(0.5 mg/kg, once daily for 20 days), followed by injection of P (5 mg/kg) into the lateral muscle of the hind-limb, once daily for 5 days, and the rats of the control group were treated by muscular injection of normal saline at the same site and in the same procedures. Acupoint group A composed of bilateral Tianzhong (SI 11), Ganshu (BL 18) and Zusanli (ST 36), and group B composed of Tanzhong (CV 17), and bilateral Wuyi (ST 15) and Hegu (LI 4) were alternatively punctured with filiform needles and stimulated swiftly by twirling the needle in each acupoint for 20－30 sec, once daily for 30 days. Rats of the medication group and acupuncture ＋medication group were treated by gavage of Rule Granule fluid containing Baishao (Paeonia Iactiflora Pall), Danggui (Angelica sinensis), etc. (1.5 mL/100 g for each rat) and those of the other groups treated by gavage of distilled water (1.5 mL/100 g). The treatment was given once daily for continuous 30 d. At the end of the experiments, the rats' abdominal aorta blood was collected for assaying the contents of serum PRL, E2 and P with ELISA, and the pathological changes of breast tissue (the left 2nd pairs) were observed under microscope after sectioning and H．E. staining. The expression of PRLR, ER and PR proteins in the breast tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      After modeling, the hyperplasia of mammary gland in the model group was obvious; the serum PRL and E2 contents and the immunoactivities of PRLR, ER and PR were significantly increased (P<0.01); and the content of serum P was considerably decreased in the model group in comparison with the blank control group (P<0.01). After the treatment, the hyperplasia of mammary gland was improved; the serum PRL and E2 contents and the expression of PRLR, ER and PR were significantly decreased (P<0.05, P<0.01); and the content of P was notably increased in the acupuncture, medication and acupuncture plus medication groups relevant to the model group (P<0.05，P<0.01). The therapeutic effects of acupuncture plus medication were significantly superior to those of both simple medication and simple acupuncture in down-regulating serum PRL and E2 contents and PRLR, ER and PR immunoactivity, as well as in up-regulating serum P content (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between the medication and acupuncture groups in the above mentioned 3 serum and 3 mammary indexes (P>0.05)．.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Acupuncture, Rule Granule, and acupuncture combined with Rule Granule can improve hyperplasia of mammary gland in rats, which may be related to their effects in reducing serum PRL and E2 and breast ER, PR and PRLR expression levels, and in increasing serum P level. The therapeutic effects of acupuncture plus Rule Granule are better than those of simple acupuncture and simple Rule Granule.",

            "content": "Buxue Yimu Pill (BYP) is a classic gynecological medicine in China, which is composed of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, Leonurus japonicus Houtt, Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge, Colla corii asini and Citrus reticulata Blanco. It has been widely used in clinical therapy with the function of enriching Blood, nourishing Qi, and removing blood stasis. The current study was designed to determine the bioactive molecules and therapeutic mechanism of BYP against hemorrhagic anemia. Herein, GC-MS and UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS were employed to identify the chemical compounds from BYP. The genecards database (https: //www.genecards.org/) was used to obtain the potential target proteins related to hemorrhagic anemia. Autodock/Vina was adopted to evaluate the binding ability of protein receptors and chemical ligands. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were conducted using the ClusterProfiler. As a result, a total of 62 candidate molecules were identified and 152 targets related to hemorrhagic anemia were obtained. Furthermore, 34 active molecules and 140 targets were obtained through the virtual screening experiment. The data of molecular-target (M-T), target-pathway (T-P), and molecular-target-pathway (M-T-P) network suggested that 32 active molecules enhanced hematopoiesis and activated the immune system by regulating 57 important targets. Pharmacological experiments showed that BYP significantly increased the counts of RBC, HGB, and HCT, and significantly down-regulated the expression of EPO, IL-6, CSF3, NOS2, VEGFA, PDGFRB, and TGFB1. The results also showed that leonurine, leonuriside B, leosibiricin, ononin, rutin, astragaloside I, riligustilide and levistolide A, were the active molecules closely related to enriching Blood. In conclusion, based on molecular docking, network pharmacology and validation experiment results, the enriching blood effect of BYP on hemorrhagic anemia may be associated with hematopoiesis, anti-inflammation, and immunity enhancement.",

Although it has a high prevalence and can even trigger the premature end of conventional cancer therapies, there is no standard management. This study aims to evaluate whether topical use of Jaungo (Shiunko), a traditional herbal ointment mainly composed of Lithospermi radix and Angelica sinensis, could reduce RID compared to the water-in-oil type non-steroidal moisturizer in patients with breast cancer. Methods: This is a prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled pilot trial that investigates the effect of topical application of Jaungo for the prevention of RID in postoperative breast cancer patients scheduled for RT, in comparison with the non-steroidal moisturizer, with a random distribution of 50 patients across the two groups. RT will be administered for 5-7 weeks with a biological equivalent dose (BED10) of 60 Gy or more, and the interventions will be applied 3 times a day during RT duration. Participants will be assessed a total of nine times, including eight visits during the period of RT and one visit at a 2-week follow-up period after the end of treatment. The incidence and severity of RID, quality of life, skin reaction symptoms, and maximum pain related to RID will be measured. The incidence rate of grade 2 or higher RID using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) in the two groups will be statistically compared as the primary outcome. The types and frequencies of adverse events will be also collected and evaluated. All assessments will be performed by independent radiology oncologists. Discussion: This trial is currently ongoing and is recruiting. This study will determine the preventive efficacy of Jaungo in RID with postoperative breast cancer patients and provide evidence in traditional Korean medicine clinical practice.",

            "content": "Glutamate-induced neurotoxicity is one of the most important pathogenic mechanisms in neurological diseases and is widely used as an in vitro model for ischemic stroke. Senkyunolide I (SEI), an active constituent derived from traditional Chinese medicine Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. and Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, has been shown to have beneficial effects against focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats. However, the mechanisms underlying SEI-mediated neuroprotection remain not well understood. Thus, we explored the influence of SEI in glutamate-mediated injury to mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro2a) cells and determined the mechanisms involved. Neuro2a cells were treated with SEI under exposure to glutamate for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed by using WST-1 reagents, and apoptosis was evaluated using Annexin V-FITC and a PI double staining kit. The protein expression levels of p-AKT, AKT, p-GSK3β, GSK3β, p-p38, p38, p-ERK, ERK, p-JNK, JNK, Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-xl, p-Bad, Bad, p53, and cleaved caspase-3 were determined by Western blot analysis. Glutamate significantly decreased cell viability and elevated the level of apoptosis. Treatment with SEI reversed those effects. Furthermore, the expression of p-JNK/JNK and cleaved caspase-3 were also reduced after treatment with SEI. Our findings demonstrate that SEI protected Neuro2a cells against glutamate toxicity by regulating JNK/caspase-3 pathway and apoptosis. Thus, SEI maybe a promising candidate for neuroprotection.",

            "content": "Migraine is a recurrent disease with complex pathogenesis and is difficult to cure. At present, commercially available western migraine drugs are prone to generate side effects while treating the disease. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) avoids side effects via treatment with the principles of \"treating both symptoms and root causes\", \"overall adjustment\", and \"treatment based on syndrome differentiation\". Three strategies of drug treatment were developed based on the syndromes, i.e., removing stasis, calming liver Yang, and reinforcing deficiency. Prescriptions of removing stasis mostly contain Chuanxiong rhizome (Chuan Xiong) to remove blood stasis by promoting blood circulation and improve properties of hemorheology, and Da Chuan Xiong Formula (DCXF) is a traditional prescription widely used in clinical practice. Prescriptions of calming liver Yang usually take Ramulus Uncariae cum Uncis (Gou Teng) as the main herb, which can calm the liver Yang via improving vasomotor function, and Tian Ma Gou Teng Decoction (TMGTD) is the representative drug. For reinforcing deficiency, Chinese doctors frequently utilize Angelica Sinensis (Dang Gui) and Astragali Radix (Huang Qi) to nourish blood and Qi in order to improve the weak state of human body; Dang Gui Bu Xue Decoction (DGBXD) is the commonly used prescription. These strategies not only treat the symptoms of diseases but also their root causes, and with the features of multiple targets, in multiple ways. Therefore, TCM prescriptions have obvious advantages in the treatment of chronic diseases such as migraine. In this review, we provided an overview of the pathogenesis of migraine and the function of representative TCM preparations in therapy of migraine as well as the mechanism of action according to effective researches, in order to provide reference and clue for further researches.",

            "content": "BACKGROUND Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the major causes of vision impairment. Z-ligustilide (3-butylidene-4,5-dihydrophthalide; Z-LIG) is an important volatile oil from the Chinese herb Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels. It has been extensively studied and reportedly has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, analgesic, vasodilatory, and neuroprotective effects. Its effects on DR, however, remain obscure. In this study, we attempted to explore the protective effects of Z-LIG on retinal dysfunction and the potential underlying mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS A diabetic rat model was constructed with streptozotocin injection. Three study groups were constituted: control (CON), diabetic model (DM), and DM+Z-LIG. The DM+Z-LIG group was injected intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg of Z-LIG. The other groups received the same volume of 3% solution of polysorbate 80. After a 12-week intervention, a series of assessments were performed, including tests for retinal function, morphology, and molecular biology. RESULTS Z-LIG treatment significantly elevated b-wave and OPs2-wave amplitude and thickened the inner layer of the nucleus of the retina, and the outer plexiform and nuclear layers (INL+OPL+ONL). Moreover, the rate of apoptosis and expression of bcl-2- associated X protein (BAX) and cleaved-Caspase-3 were clearly reduced, and the expression of bcl-2 was raised by Z-LIG in retinas of diabetic mice. In addition, the levels of retinal proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were downregulated by Z-LIG. Furthermore, Z-LIG inhibited expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-alpha (VEGF-alpha) at the mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSIONS Z-LIG can inhibit inflammatory response and cell apoptosis in retinas of diabetic rats by repressing the VEGF-alpha pathway. Therefore, it may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for DR.",

            "content": "The anti-thrombic properties of the Korean herbal medicine, Dae-Jo-Hwan (DJW) were investigated. Water extracts, a 70% methanol (MeOH) extract and an ethyl acetate (EtOAc) soluble fraction (III) from DJW inhibited platelet-activating factor (PAF)-induced platelet aggregation in vitro and in vivo assays. The extracts of DJW and eleven herbs from which it is derived, except for Panax ginseng Meyer, Angelica sinensis (OLIV.) DIELS and Schisandra chinensis Baill., inhibited AA-induced blood platelet aggregation to various extents. The effects observed with total DJW was synergistic over-additive rather that additive since the sum of single contributions was lower than the effect of the total extract. Fraction III was specially protected against the lethality of PAF, while verapamil did not afford any protection. Exogenously applied arachidonic acid (AA) (100 microM) led to a 89% platelet aggregation, the release of 14 pmol of ATP, and the formation of either 225 pg of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) or 45 pg of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), each parameter being related to 10(6) platelets. An application of DJW 5 min before AA, dose-dependently diminished aggregation, ATP-re lease, and the synthesis of TXA2 and PGE2, with IC(50) values of 70, 87, 65 and 72 microg/ml, respectively. The similarity of the IC(50) values suggests the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) by DJW as the primary target, thus suppressing the generation of TXA2, which induces platelet aggregation and the exocytosis of ATP by its binding on TXA2-receptors. These results indicate that DJW shows anti-thrombotic action on human platelets and inhibits the action of PAF in vivo by an antagonistic effect on PAF. Therefore, it may be useful in treating disorders caused by PAF.",

One such treatment to consider is BeauTop (BT), whose primary ingredients include Panax japonicus (T.Nees), C.A. Mey. (Araliaceae), Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch) Bunge (Fabaceae), Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (Apiaceae), Ligustrum lucidum W.T. Aiton (Oleaceae), Rehmannia glutinosa (Gaertn.) DC.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether BT can promote hair growth in C57BL/6 mice and to investigate hair coverage, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEFG), and the numbers of hair follicles in growth phase after oral administration. A total of 12 C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups: control group and treatment group BT. BT was administered orally as an extract at a volume of 0.6 g/kg. The control group was treated with distilled water. Each group was treated once a day for 12 consecutive days. To observe the expression of VEGF distribution, the number of hair follicles and the hair coverage were examined on days 4, 8, and 12. By comparing the treatment group and control group, we found that VEGF in the BT group on day 8 presented with a higher area percentage than the control group (p value = 0.003). Hair follicle counting results showed that the BT group was significantly higher than the control group on day 8 (p value = 0.031). Furthermore, hair coverage was shown to be significantly increased in the treatment group BT on day 8 (p value = 0.013). Taken together, these results suggest that Chinese medicine (BT) possesses the potential effect of promoting hair growth through VEGF expression. VEGF is considered the most important mediator for the process of angiogenesis involved in hair growth development.",

Ferulic acid (FA), a component in both AS and LC, plays a role in neuroprotection. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of FA on cerebral infarct and the involvement of neuroprotective pathway. Rats underwent 2 hours and 24 hours of reperfusion after 90 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). The cerebral infarct and neurological deficits were measured after 24 hours of reperfusion. Furthermore, the expression of superoxide radicals, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) immunoreactive cells were assessed after 2 hours and 24 hours of reperfusion. Administration of 80 and 100 mg/kg of FA at the beginning of MCAo significantly reduced cerebral infarct and neurological deficit-score, similar results were obtained by 100 mg/kg of FA administered 30 min after MCAo. FA treatment (100 mg/kg i.v.) effectively suppressed superoxide radicals in the parenchyma lesion, and ICAM-1 immunoreactive vessels in the ischemic striatum after 2 hours of reperfusion. FA (100 mg/kg i.v.) reduced the expression of ICAM-1 and NF-kappaB in the ischemic cortex and striatum, also down-regulated MPO immunoreactive cells in the ischemic cortex after 24 hours of reperfusion. These results showed that the effect of FA on reducing cerebral infarct area and neurological deficit-score were at least partially attributed to the inhibition of superoxide radicals, ICAM-1 and NF-kappaB expression in transient MCAo rats.",

            "content": "Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) and butylidenephthalide (BP) are two bioactive components isolated from Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort and Angelica sinensis, respectively. These two traditional Chinese medicines have been widely used in clinical treatments for vascular disease. The mechanism by which TMP and BP protect endothelial cells (ECs) against oxidative stress remains unknown, as does their effects on the steady state of the lipidome of ECs. Here, we demonstrate that both compounds protect EA.hy926 cells against H(2)O(2) induced injury in a dose-dependent manner. We then apply an integrated analysis of the lipidome and signal transduction pathways to explore the underlying mechanism of their protective effects. We found that TMP elevates the content of several phosphatidylcholine (PC) species, reduces the release of arachidonic acid (AA) and inhibits the phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)). Compared to eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), a cPLA(2) inhibitor, TMP preferentially increases the content of arachidonoyl PCs. We also show that BP mainly elevates the pool of phosphatidylinositol (PI) species and inhibits the phosphorylation of both phospholipase C(γ) (PLC(γ)) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). In contrast, specific inhibition of ERK1/2 by PD98059 decreases the cell viability and increases pool of phosphatidylserine (PS). Taken together, these results demonstrate that TMP protects oxidatively stressed ECs through inhibition of cPLA(2) and preferential increase of arachidonoyl PC levels. Conversely, the effects of BP are tied to inhibition of PLC(γ) and an increase in PI levels. The current work suggests that the interaction of the lipidome and phospholipases can serve as a promising therapeutic target in oxidatively stressed ECs.",

The abnormal activation of glycolytic metabolism and PTEN/AKT signaling in NSCLC cells are highly correlated with their proliferation abilities and viability. Ligustilide is one of the major bioactive components of multiple Chinese traditional medicine including Angelica sinensis and Ligusticum. Ligustilide exposure inhibits the proliferation and viability of multiple cancer cell lines in vitro. However, the impact of ligustilide to the progression of NSCLC and its detailed pharmacological mechanisms remain unclear. In this research, CCK-8 and colony formation assay were performed to demonstrate ligustilide treatment inhibited the viability and proliferation ability of NSCLC cells in vitro. Caspase-3/-7 activity assay and nucleosome ELISA assay were utilized to show ligustilide promoted the apoptosis of NSCLC cells. Metabolic analysis and qRT-PCR assay were used to demonstrated that ligustilide dampened aerobic glycolysis of NSCLC cells. Nude mice were exposed to 5 mg/kg ligustilide and ligustilide inhibited orthotopic NSCLC growth in vivo. qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to substantiate the regulatory function of ligustilide to PTEN/AKT signaling in NSCLC cells. Overall, this study revealed that ligustilide regulated the proliferation, apoptosis and aerobic glycolysis of NSCLC cells through PTEN/AKT signaling pathway.",

            "content": "Botanical dietary supplements are increasingly popular for women's health, particularly for older women. The specific botanicals women take vary as a function of age. Younger women will use botanicals for urinary tract infections, especially Vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberry), where there is evidence for efficacy. Botanical dietary supplements for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) are less commonly used, and rigorous clinical trials have not been done. Some examples include Vitex agnus-castus (chasteberry), Angelica sinensis (dong quai), Viburnum opulus/prunifolium (cramp bark and black haw), and Zingiber officinale (ginger). Pregnant women have also used ginger for relief from nausea. Natural galactagogues for lactating women include Trigonella foenum-graecum (fenugreek) and Silybum marianum (milk thistle); however, rigorous safety and efficacy studies are lacking. Older women suffering menopausal symptoms are increasingly likely to use botanicals, especially since the Women's Health Initiative showed an increased risk for breast cancer associated with traditional hormone therapy. Serotonergic mechanisms similar to antidepressants have been proposed for Actaea/Cimicifuga racemosa (black cohosh) and Valeriana officinalis (valerian). Plant extracts with estrogenic activities for menopausal symptom relief include Glycine max (soy), Trifolium pratense (red clover), Pueraria lobata (kudzu), Humulus lupulus (hops), Glycyrrhiza species (licorice), Rheum rhaponticum (rhubarb), Vitex agnus-castus (chasteberry), Linum usitatissimum (flaxseed), Epimedium species (herba Epimedii, horny goat weed), and Medicago sativa (alfalfa). Some of the estrogenic botanicals have also been shown to have protective effects against osteoporosis. Several of these botanicals could have additional breast cancer preventive effects linked to hormonal, chemical, inflammatory, and/or epigenetic pathways. Finally, although botanicals are perceived as natural safe remedies, it is important for women and their healthcare providers to realize that they have not been rigorously tested for potential toxic effects and/or drug/botanical interactions. Understanding the mechanism of action of these supplements used for women's health will ultimately lead to standardized botanical products with higher efficacy, safety, and chemopreventive properties.",

Hua-Zheng-Hui-Sheng-Dan (HZHSD) was used as an experimental model to explore research methods of large formulae in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) using current molecular biology approaches. Materials and Methods. The trypan blue exclusion assay was used to determine cell viability and cell numbers. Flow cytometry was used to assess cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. The concentration of cyclin D1 was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The median effect principle was used in drug combination studies. An orthogonal experimental design was used to estimate the effects of each herb at different concentrations. The HeLa xenograft mouse model was used to compare the antitumor activity of drugs in vivo. Results. Among the 35 herbs that comprise HZHSD, Radix Rehmanniae Preparata (RRP), Caesalpinia sappan (CS), Evodia rutaecarpa (ER), Folium Artemisiae Argyi (FAA), Leonurus japonicus Houtt (LJH), Tumeric (Tu), Radix Paeoniae Alba (RPA), and Trogopterus Dung (TD) effectively inhibited the proliferation of HeLa and SKOV3 cells. Only RRR had an effect on HeLa and SKOV3 cell viability. According to the median effect principle, Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) (AS), Tabanus (Ta), and Pollen Typhae (PT), which were proven to have a significant synergistic inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HeLa cells, were added to the original eight positive herbs. The combination of RPA and AS had a synergistic effect on inducing cell cycle S phase arrest and decreasing intracellular cyclin D1 in HeLa cells. By orthogonal experimental design, LJH and Tu were considered unnecessary herbs. The small formula (SHZHSD) consisted of RPA, AS, RRR, Ta., TD, PT, ER, CS, and FAA and was able to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis. The antitumor effects of HZHSD and SHZHSD were also compared in vivo. Conclusions. Through molecular biology approaches both in vitro and in vivo, research into single drugs, and analysis using the median effect principle and orthogonal experimental design, the small formula (SHZHSD) was determined from the original formula (HZHSD).

In the present study, we intravenously injected ligustilide daily for 4 days, with the first injection given at 1 h before complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) injection. We tested the analgesic effect of ligustilide by behavioral test and checked the expression and distribution of TLR4 in the spinal cord by real-time quantitative PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Our data showed that repeated daily intravenous treatment with ligustilide alleviated CFA-induced heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. The same treatment also inhibited CFA-induced TLR4 mRNA and protein increase in the spinal cord. Immunofluorescence double staining showed that TLR4 was predominantly expressed in spinal astrocytes. In primary cultured astrocytes, ligustilide dose-dependently reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced upregulation of TLR4 mRNA expression. These data indicate that ligustilide treatment reduces TLR4 expression in spinal astrocytes and is an effective therapy for inflammatory pain.",

            "content": "Background:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT), a Chinese herbal decoction containing Astragali Radix (AR; roots of Astragalus memebranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge var. mongholicus (Bunge) Hsiao) and Angelicae Sinensis Radix (ASR; roots of Angelica sinensis Oliv.) at a weight ratio of 5:1, is used to improve menopausal syndromes in women. Several lines of evidence indicate that DBT has strong estrogenic property; however, the action mechanism of this herbal decoction is not known. Calycosin, a major flavonoid in AR, shares similar structure with β-estradiol, and thus which is hypothesized to be the key compound of DBT in responsible for such estrogenic properties.,Aims:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      We aimed to determine the role of calycosin in DBT in terms of its estrogenic functions by the creation of calycosin-depleted DBT (DBTΔcal) and calycosin-added DBT (DBT+cal) herbal extracts.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The signalings triggered by DBT∆cal, DBT+cal, and parental DBT were compared in cultured MCF-7 cells by determining: (i) the activation of estrogen responsive element; (ii) the phosphorylation of estrogen receptor α (ERα); and (iii) the phosphorylation of Erk1/2. The DBT-induced responses were in dose- and/or time-dependent manners.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The estrogenic signals triggered by DBT were markedly reduced in DBTΔcal, and in contrast the addition of calycosin in DBT, i.e. DBT+cal, enhanced the responses by 2-5 folds; however, calycosin alone did not show such properties. In parallel, the DBT-induced responses could be significantly blocked by inhibitors for estrogen receptor and mitogen activated protein kinases.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Thus, we hypothesize that calycosin is an indispensable chemical in DBT, and which plays a linker in orchestrating multi-components of DBT as to achieve the maximal estrogenic functions. These discoveries should be invaluable in drug development and in investigating the modernization of traditional Chinese medicine from a new perspective.",

Previous studies demonstrated that Z-LIG had significant neuroprotective potential in both transient and permanent cerebral ischemia, possibly through antioxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. The present study examined the mechanisms of Z-LIG on hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced injury in PC12 cells. Following exposure of the cells to H(2)O(2 )(500 microM), a significant reduction in cell survival and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), as well as increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), were observed. In addition, H(2)O(2 )treatment significantly upregulated Bax expression, cleaved-caspase 3, and cytosolic cytochrome-c, and decreased Bcl-2 protein levels. Pretreatment of the cells with Z-LIG (0.1, 1.0, 2.5, or 5.0 microg/ml) significantly attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced cell death, attenuated increased intracellular ROS levels, and decreased Bax expression, cleaved-caspase 3, and cytochrome-c. Further, Z-LIG improved cellular TAC and concentration-dependently upregulated Bcl-2 expression. These results demonstrate that Z-LIG has a pronounced protective effect against H(2)O(2)-induced cytotoxicity, at least partly through improving cellular antioxidant defense and inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. These findings suggest that Z-LIG may be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in which oxidative stress and apoptosis are mainly implicated.",

            "content": "Fukeqianjin formula, a traditional Chinese medicine compound, consists of eight Chinese medicinal materials including roots of Moghania macrophylla, roots of Rosa laevigata, aerial parts of Andrographis paniculata, caulis of Mahonia fortunei, roots of Zanthoxylum dissitum, roots of Angelica sinensis, caulis of Spatholobus suberectus, and roots of Codonopsis pilosula. The chemical constituents from Fukeqianjin formula were studied in this paper. The compounds were separated and purified by repeated column chromatographic methods including silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, macroporous adsorptive resin, and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. And their chemical structures were determined by spectral data analyses. Thirty-eight compounds were obtained and identified as Z-3-butylidenephthalide (1), Z-ligustilide (2), senkyunolide I (3), senkyunolide H (4), vanillin (5), 7-O-methylwogonin (6), wogonin (7), panicolin (8), 19-hydroxy-8(17),13-labdadien-15,16-olide (9), andrograpanin (3,14-dideoxyandrographolide; 10), andrographolide (11), 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide (12), isoandrographolide (13), andrographin (2'-O-methylskullcapflavone, 14), biochanin A (15), 5-hydroxy-7,8,2',5'-tetramethoxyflavone (16), formononetin (17), daidzein (18), genistein (19), benzoic acid (20), vanillic acid (21), trans-ferulic acid (22), salicylic acid (23), daidzin (24), genistein-7-O-β-D-apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (25), apigenin-7-O-β-D-glucuronide (26), andrographidin C (27), apigenin-7-O-β-D-(6\"-methyl)glucuronide (28), neoandrographolide (29), genistin (30), andrographiside (31), 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographiside (32), lobetyolin (33), epicatechin (34), catechin (35), palmatine (36), berberine (37), and jatrorrhizine (38), respectively. From the results of an individual medicinal material studies, it can be judged that compounds 17, 19, 24 and 30 as flavonoids came from the roots of M. macrophylla, compounds 36-38 as alkaloids came from the caulis of M. fortunei, compounds 6-8, 14, 16, and 27 as flavonoids as well as 9-13, 29, 31, and 32 as diterpenes came from the aerial parts of A. paniculata, compound 5 as phenols came from the roots of Z. dissitum, compounds 1-4 as phthalides as well as compound 22 as phenylpropanoids came from the roots of A. sinensis, compound 33 as alkynes came from the roots of C. pilosula, compounds 15, 17-19 as flavonoids as well as compound 21 as phenolic acids came from the caulis of S. suberectus. While compounds 34 and 35 as flavanoids could come from both the caulis of S. suberectus and roots of R. laevigata. The chemical composition of traditional Chinese medicine compound can be tracked from the original sources. This work provides a demonstration for the material basis study of traditional Chinese medicine compound. Compounds 25, 26 and 28 have not so far been isolated and identified from the above-mentioned single herb.",

            "content": "In order to serve population health better, the first integrated tiered decision tree for cumulative risk assessment of co-exposure of Pb-, Cd-, and As-associated health risks in food homologous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) was designed, after measuring their concentrations by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Basically, our three-step decision tree involving hazard quotient (HQ), hazard index (HI), and target-organ toxicity dose (TTD) modification of the HI method was developed to evaluate the potential risks of 949 batches of 15 types of food homologous TCM. To acquire a real-life exposure scenario, the cumulative risk assessment model was established by optimizing key parameters, such as ingestion rates, frequency, and duration of exposure to food homologous TCM based on questionnaire data. As a result, the mean concentrations of Pb, Cd, and As in 949 batches of food homologous TCM were 0.896, 0.133, and 0.192 mg/kg, respectively. The HQ values of As for Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels and Houttuynia cordata Thunb. were 1.04 and 1.01, respectively, for females. Other HQs of Pb, Cd, or As in food homologous TCM were lower than 1 for both males and females. However, after rapid screening of the co-exposure health risks of heavy metals by the HI method, cumulative risk assessment results acquired by TTD modification of the HI method implied that the potential health risks associated with the co-exposure of Pb, Cd, and As in Lonicera japonica Thunb. and Houttuynia cordata Thunb. ingested as both TCM and food were of concern in the clinic. Additionally, the cumulative risks of Pb, Cd, and As in Mentha canadensis L., Chrysanthemum indicum L., and Zaocys dhumnades (Cantor) only used as food exceeded the human tolerance dose. Collectively, our innovation on the tiered strategy of decision tree based on a real-life exposure scenario provides a novel approach engaging in the cumulative risk assessment of heavy metals in food homologous TCM. All in all, such effort attempts to scientifically guide the rational use of TCM in the treatment of the complex diseases and the improvement of population health.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic and radiosensitizing effect of BP and the underlying mechanism of action in human breast cancer cells. BP induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells, which was revealed by the TUNEL assay; the activation of caspase-9 and PARP was detected by western blot. In addition, BP-induced G2/M arrest was examined by flow cytometry and the expression levels of the G2/M regulatory protein were detected by western blot. BP also suppresses the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, which was tested by wound healing and the matrigel invasion assay; the involvement of EMT-related gene expressions was detected by real-time PCR. Furthermore, BP enhanced the radiosensitivity of breast cancer cells, which was measured by the colony formation assay and comet assay, where the foci of γ-H2AX after radiation significantly increased in BP pretreated cells and was evidenced by immunocytochemistry staining and western blot. The homologous recombination (HR) repair protein Rad51 was down-regulated after BP pretreatment. These results indicate that BP might be a potential chemotherapeutic and radiosensitizing agent for breast cancer therapy.",

This study aims to identify potential lead compounds from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) using virtual screening for SET domain containing 2 (SETD2) protein against acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Docking simulation was performed to determine potential candidates which obtain suitable docking poses in the binding domain of the SETD2 protein. We also performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to investigate the stability of docking poses of SETD2 protein complexes with the top three TCM candidates and a control. According to the results of docking and MD simulation, coniselin and coniferyl ferulate have high binding affinity and stable interactions with the SETD2 protein. Coniselin is isolated from the alcoholic extract of Comiselinum vaginatum Thell. Coniferyl ferulate can be isolated from Angelica sinensis, Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf, and Notopterygium forbesii. Although S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine has more stable interactions with key residues in the binding domain than coniselin and coniferyl ferulate during MD simulation, the TCM compounds coniselin and coniferyl ferulate are still potential candidates as lead compounds for further study in the drug development process with the SETD2 protein against acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.",

            "content": "Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang (BYHWT) is a popular Traditional Chinese Medicine formula consisting of seven herbal medicines (Astragalus membranaceus, Angelica sinensis, Paeonia lactiflora, Ligusticum chuanxiong, Carthamus tinctorius, Amygdalus persica and Pheretima aspergillum), that has been used in China for centuries to overcome stroke-induced disability. To ensure the consistency of quality, a reliable analytical method is required, therefore, we developed a liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for quantitative analysis of the major constituents in BYHWT. The herbal ingredients consisting of the cycloartane-type triterpene glycosides of astragaloside I, astragaloside II and astragaloside IV; isoflavones of formononetin, ononin calycosin, calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside; ligustilide and paeoniflorin were separated on a C18 column with gradient elution of methanol/10 mM ammonium acetate buffer-formic acid (100:0.1, v/v). This study was performed by a mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization (ESI) with positive ionization ions monitored in the multiple reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode. The linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection (LOD) and lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were validated for this quantification method, and the sensitivity, reliability and reproducibility were all confirmed. The experiments provided a good method for analyzing BYHWT extracts. This study also quantitated the active components in various brands of commercially available products. The results indicated that the pharmaceutical industrial products of BYHWT exhibited considerable variation in their contents of the herbal compounds.",

To determine the mechanism of BP-induced growth arrest and apoptosis, we examined BP-induced changes in gene expression by microarray screening using human GBM brain tumor cells. This analysis identified several BP-inducible genes, including the nuclear receptors NOR-1, Nurr1, and Nur77. Among these genes, Nur77 is particularly interesting because it plays an important role in the apoptotic processes in various tumor cell lines. BP was able to increase Nur77 mRNA and protein expression in a time-dependent manner. After BP treatment in GBM 8401 cells, Nur77 translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, the cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria, and caspase 3 became activated. Furthermore, using Nur77 promoter-luciferase assay, BP increased Nur77 was AP1 related. Inhibition of BP-induced Nur77 expression by Nur77 short interfering RNA blocked BP-induced apoptosis in GBM 8401 cells, suggesting that the induction of Nur77 negatively affected GBM 8401 cell survival. In summary, our results suggest that up-regulation of Nur77 may explain the antitumoral activity of BP in brain tumor cells.",

            "content": "Eight botanical preparations that are commonly used for the treatment of menopausal symptoms were tested for estrogenic activity. Methanol extracts of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), chasteberry (Vitex agnus-castus L.), and hops (Humulus lupulus L.) showed significant competitive binding to estrogen receptors alpha (ER alpha) and beta (ER beta). With cultured Ishikawa (endometrial) cells, red clover and hops exhibited estrogenic activity as indicated by induction of alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity and up-regulation of progesterone receptor (PR) mRNA. Chasteberry also stimulated PR expression, but no induction of AP activity was observed. In S30 breast cancer cells, pS2 (presenelin-2), another estrogen-inducible gene, was up-regulated in the presence of red clover, hops, and chasteberry. Interestingly, extracts of Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer) and North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) induced pS2 mRNA expression in S30 cells, but no significant ER binding affinity, AP induction, or PR expression was noted in Ishikawa cells. Dong quai [Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels] and licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.) showed only weak ER binding and PR and pS2 mRNA induction. Black cohosh [Cimicifuga racemosa (L.) Nutt.] showed no activity in any of the above in vitro assays. Bioassay-guided isolation utilizing ER competitive binding as a monitor and screening using ultrafiltration LC-MS revealed that genistein was the most active component of red clover. Consistent with this observation, genistein was found to be the most effective of four red clover isoflavones tested in the above in vitro assays. Therefore, estrogenic components of plant extracts can be identified using assays for estrogenic activity along with screening and identification of the active components using ultrafiltration LC-MS. These data suggest a potential use for some dietary supplements, ingested by human beings, in the treatment of menopausal symptoms.",

In this study, a rapid and sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was established and validated for the determination of vanillic acid in rat plasma. Plasma samples were prepared by protein precipitation with acetonitrile. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Zorbax RRHD Eclipse Plus C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.8 μm) with gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, using mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B).

            "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) causes motor dysfunction and dopaminergic cell death. Drug treatments can effectively reduce symptoms but often cause unwanted side effects. Stem cell therapies using cell replacement or indirect beneficial secretomes have recently emerged as potential therapeutic strategies. Although various types of stem cells have been proposed as possible candidates, adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are easily obtainable, more abundant, less ethically disputed, and able to differentiate into multiple cell lineages. However, treatment of PD using adult stem cells is known to be less efficacious than neuron or embryonic stem cell transplantation. Therefore, improved therapies are urgently needed. n-Butylidenephthalide (BP), which is extracted from Angelica sinensis, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that BP treatment of ADSCs enhances the expression of neurogenesis and homing factors such as nuclear receptor related 1 protein, stromal-derived factor 1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. In the present study, we examined the ability of BP-pretreated ADSC transplantation to improve PD motor symptoms and protect dopamine neurons in a mouse model of PD. We evaluated the results using neuronal behavior tests such as beam walking, rotarod, and locomotor activity tests. ADSCs with or without BP pretreatment were transplanted into the striatum. Our findings demonstrated that ADSC transplantation improved motor abilities with varied efficacies and that BP stimulation improved the therapeutic effects of transplantation. Dopaminergic cell numbers returned to normal in ADSC-transplanted mice after 22 d. In summary, stimulating ADSCs with BP improved PD recovery efficiency. Thus, our results provide important new strategies to improve stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases in future studies.",

Ferulic acid (FA) is a major active component of angelica sinensis and has been reported to exert antidepressant-like effects; however, it remains unknown whether FA ameliorate chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain and the involvement of descending monoaminergic system and opioid receptors. Chronic treatment with FA (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg) ameliorated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in von Frey hair and hot plate tasks, accompanied by increasing spinal noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) levels. Subsequent study suggested that treatment of CCI animals with 40 and 80 mg/kg FA also inhibited spinal MAO-A levels. FA's effects on mechanical allodynia or thermal hyperalgesiawas blocked by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) via pharmacological depletion of spinal noradrenaline or serotonin. Moreover, the anti-allodynic action of FA on mechanical stimuli was prevented by pre-treatment with beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551, or by the delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole. While the anti-hyperalgesia on thermal stimuli induced by FA was blocked by pre-treatment with 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635, or with the irreversible mu-opioid receptor antagonist beta-funaltrexamine. These results suggest that the effect of FA on neuropathic pain is potentially mediated via amelioration of the descending monoaminergic system that coupled with spinal beta2- and 5-HT1A receptors and the downstream delta- and mu-opioid receptors differentially.",

This retrospective study was designed to evaluate the effects of XBJ combined with conventional therapy on mortality risk of patients with acute paraquat poisoning. Out of 68 patients, 27 were treated with conventional therapy (control group) and 41 were treated with intravenous administration of XBJ (100 ml, twice a day, up to 7 days) plus conventional therapy (XBJ group). Vital organ function, survival time within 28 days and adverse events during the treatment were reviewed. Results indicated that XBJ treatment significantly increased median survival time among patients ingesting 10-30 ml of paraquat (P=0.02) compared with the control group. After adjustment for covariates, XBJ treatment was associated significantly with a lower mortality risk (adjusted HR 0.242, 95% CI 0.113 to 0.516, P=0.001) compared with the control group. Additionally, compared with Day 1, on Day 3 the value of PaO2/FiO2 was significantly decreased, and the values of serum alanine aminotransferase, creatinine and troponin T were significantly increased in the control group (all P<0.05), but these values were significant improved in the XBJ group (all P<0.05). Only one patient had skin rash with itch within 30 minutes after injection and no severe adverse events were found in the XBJ group. In conclusion, XBJ treatment is associated with decreased mortality risk of patients with moderate paraquat poisoning, which may be attributed to improved function of vital organs with no severe adverse events.",

In biochemical parameters, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), corticosterone, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and antioxidants (superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase) were measured. Five groups of animals used were of control, negative control, and three separate groups treated with 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg of VA, respectively, for 28 d. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of STZ were performed for all groups except control on 14th and 16th of 28 d of VA treatment.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      VA improved spatial learning and memory retention by preventing oxidative stress compared with control animals. VA at 50 and 100 mg/kg dose significantly (p < 0.001) improved the habituation memory, decreased the AChE, corticosterone, TNF-α, and increased the antioxidants (p < 0.001). VA (100 mg/kg) exhibited dose-dependent effect in all parameters with p < 0.001 except antioxidants in which VA showed the significance of p < 0.01.,Discussion and conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      VA exhibited reduction in AChE, TNF-α, and corticosterone with improved antioxidants to contribute neuroprotection and could be an effective therapeutic agent for treating neurodegenerative disorders.",

            "content": "Oral cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, especially in South Central Asia. It has been suggested that cancer stem cells (CSC) play crucial roles in tumor relapse and metastasis, and approaches to target CSC may lead to promising results. Here, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) and CD44 were utilized to isolate CSCs of oral cancer. Butylidenephthalide, a bioactive phthalide compound from Angelica sinensis, was tested for its anti-CSC effects. MTT assay showed that a lower concentration of butylidenephthalide was sufficient to inhibit the proliferation of patient-derived ALDH1+/CD44+ cells without affecting normal cells. Administration of butylidenephthalide not only reduced ALDH1 activity and CD44 expression, it also suppressed the migration, invasion, and colony formation abilities of ALDH1+/CD44+ cells using a transwell system and clonogenic assay. A patient-derived xenograft mouse model supported our in vitro findings that butylidenephthalide possessed the capacity to retard tumor development. We found that butylidenephthalide dose-dependently downregulated the gene and protein expression of Sox2 and Snail. Our results demonstrated that overexpression of Snail in ALDH1-/CD44- (non-CSCs) cells induced the CSC phenotypes, whereas butylidenephthalide treatment successfully diminished the enhanced self-renewal and propagating properties. In summary, this study showed that butylidenephthalide may serve as an adjunctive for oral cancer therapy.",

            "content": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been practiced in the treatment of bone diseases and alcoholism. Chronic excessive alcohol use results in alcohol-induced bone diseases, including osteopenia and osteoporosis, which increases fracture risk, deficient bone repair, and osteonecrosis. This preclinical study investigated the therapeutic effects of TCM herbal extracts in animal models of chronic excessive alcohol consumption-induced osteopenia. TCM herbal extracts (Jing extracts) were prepared from nine Chinese herbal medicines, a combinative herbal formula for antifatigue and immune regulation, including Astragalus, Cistanche deserticola, Dioscorea polystachya, Lycium barbarum, Epimedium, Cinnamomum cassia, Syzygium aromaticum, Angelica sinensis, and Curculigo orchioides. In this study, Balb/c male mice were orally administrated alcohol (3.2 g/kg/day) with/without TCM herbal extracts (0.125 g/kg, 0.25 g/kg, or 0.5 g/kg) by gavage. Our results showed that after 50 days of oral administration, TCM herbal extracts prevented alcohol-induced osteopenia demonstrated by μ-CT bone morphological analysis in young adults and middle-aged/old Balb/c male mice. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that chronic alcohol consumption inhibits bone formation and has a neutral impact on bone resorption, suggesting that TCM herbal extracts (Jing extracts) mitigate the alcohol-induced abnormal bone metabolism in middle-aged/old male mice. Protocatechuic acid, a natural phenolic acid in Jing extracts, mitigates in vivo alcohol-induced decline of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) gene expression in the bone marrow of Balb/c male mice and in vitro ALP activity in pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells. Our study suggests that TCM herbal extracts prevent chronic excessive alcohol consumption-induced osteopenia in male mice, implying that traditional medicinal plants have the therapeutic potential of preventing alcohol-induced bone diseases.",

            "content": "Chinese herbal medicines have long been used for the treatment of dysmenorrhea. The treatment experiences of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pharmacies passed down through generations have contributed to a wealth of prescriptions for dysmenorrhea that have achieved significant therapeutic effects in countless Taiwanese women. Therefore, surveying and analyzing these prescriptions may enable us to elucidate the core medication combinations used in TCM prescriptions for dysmenorrhea. In the present study, a field investigation was conducted on various TCM pharmacies in Taiwan. A total of 96 TCM pharmacies were sampled, and 99 prescriptions for dysmenorrhea containing 77 different medicinal materials were collected. Compositae (8%) was the most common botanical source of the medicinal materials, and the predominant TCM property and flavor of the materials were warm (45%) and sweet (73%), respectively. The blood-activating and stasis-dispelling effect (23%) and the qi-tonifying effect (23%) were the most prevalent traditional effects, and the modern pharmacological effects most commonly found in the materials were anti-inflammatory (73%), antitumor (59%), and analgesic (12%) effects. Network analysis of the 77 medicinal materials used in the prescriptions, which was performed using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Inheritance Support System, yielded seven core medicinal materials and the corresponding network diagram. The seven core medicinal materials ranked in order of relative frequency of citation (RFC) were Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (Dang Gui), Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort (Chuan Qiong), Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch (Di Huang), Paeonia lactiflora Pall (Bai Shao), Hedysarum polybotrys Hand.-Mazz (Hong Qi), Lycium chinense Mill (Gou Qi Zi), and Cinnamomum cassia (L.). J. Presl (Gui Zhi). A total of 58 combinations, each consisting of two to five of the seven medicinal materials and 107 association rules among the materials, were identified. This study provides a record of valuable knowledge on TCM pharmacy prescriptions for dysmenorrhea. The rich medicinal knowledge of TCM pharmacies in Taiwan is worthy of further exploration, and the results of this study can serve as a basis for future pharmacological research and the development of naturally derived medications for dysmenorrhea.",

However, the potential mechanism of LIG in the suppression of bladder cancer (BC) has not been reported yet. This study uncovered the inhibitory effect of LIG on the proliferation and cell cycle arrest of BC cells (T24 and EJ-1) along with unveiling the underlying molecular mechanism. The IC50 values of LIG-treated T24 for 24 and 48 h are 39.91 μg/mL (209.8 μM) and 40.94 μg/mL (215.2 μM) separately. The same conditions, the IC50 values of EJ-1 are 45.73 μg/mL (240.4 μM) and 43.81 μg/mL (230.3 μM), separately. Additionally, LIG induced apoptosis and cycle arrest of T24 and EJ-1 cells in sub-G1 phase. Further studies showed that LIG induced apoptosis of BC cells by upregulating Caspase-8, truncated BID (tBID) and BAX proteins, and downregulating NFκB1 (p50) protein. In conclusion, LIG significantly inhibits the growth of BC cells in vitro and in vivo by inducing apoptosis and is inexpensive, making it a promising candidate for novel anti-BC drugs.",

            "content": "The Buxue Tongluo pill (BTP) is a self-made pill with the functions of nourishing blood, promoting blood circulation, dredging collaterals, and relieving pain. It consists of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, Pheretima aspergillum (E.Perrier), Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F. H. Chen, Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. Various clinical practices have confirmed the therapeutic effect of BTP on osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH), but little attention has been paid to the study of its bioactive ingredients and related mechanisms of action. In this study, UPLC/MS-MS combined with GEO data mining was used to construct a bioactive ingredient library of BTP and a differentially expressed gene (DEG) library for ONFH. Subsequently, Cytoscape (3.7.2) software was used to analyze the protein-protein interaction between BTP and DEGs of ONFH to screen the key targets, and functional annotation analysis and pathway enrichment analysis were carried out. Finally, 34 bioactive compounds were screened, which acted on 1,232 targets. A total of 178 DEGs were collected, and 17 key genes were obtained after two screenings. By bioinformatics annotation on these key genes, a total of 354 gene ontology (GO) functional annotation analyses and 42 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were obtained. The present study found that GO and KEGG enrichment were mainly related to apoptosis, suggesting that BTP may exert an anti-ONFH effect by promoting osteoclast apoptosis. Experiments in vitro demonstrated that BTP could increase the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and induce remarkable apoptosis in osteoclasts. Furthermore, we determined the apoptosis marker of cleaved(C)-caspase-3, bcl-2, and bax and found that BTP could upregulate the C-caspase-3 and bax expression in osteoclasts and decrease the expression of bcl-2, p-Akt, and p-PI3K in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that BTP could induce PI3K/Akt-mediated apoptosis in osteoclasts to treat ONFH. This study explored the pharmacodynamic basis and mechanism of BTP against ONFH from the perspective of systemic pharmacology, laying a foundation for further elucidating the therapeutic effects of BTP against ONFH.",

The aim of this study was to elucidate the possible mechanism of FA, ICA, and FA-ICA on estrogen-induced mammary gland hyperplasia (MGH) in rats.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was performed to record the pathological changes in breast tissue, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was utilized to determine the serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), PRL (prolactin), testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), and progesterone (P). The message RNA (mRNA) expression levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR) were detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Furthermore, ER, phosphorylated-ER, PR, p-PR, ERK1/2, and p-ERK1/2 protein factors in the ERK signaling pathway were evaluated by Western blotting. Simultaneously, changes in breast height, diameter, body weight, and organ index were all recorded.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      We found that FA and ICA could modulate the degree of breast swelling, and reduce the body weight, thymus index, and uterus index. Furthermore, it could also block the pathological changes of MGH, including the number of mammary lobules, and the proliferation or expansion of acini and ducts. Moreover, treatment with FA and ICA remarkably down-regulated the serum expression levels of LH, PRL, T, and E2, as well as the mRNA expression levels of ERα, PR, ERK1, and ERK2. Additionally, protein levels of ERα, p-ERα, PR, p-PR, ERK1/2, and p-ERK1/2 in breast tissue were down-regulated, however the serum content of FSH and P was up-regulated.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Our outcomes revealed that FA and ICA might potentially inhibit ERα, PR, ERK1/2, and their phosphorylated proteins via the ERK signaling pathway, thus indicating a positive feedback control for the degree of breast hyperplasia.",

            "content": "The 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR; EC1.1.1.267), an NADPH-dependent reductase, plays a pivotal role in the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway (MEP), in the conversion of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) into MEP. Photochemical profiles, as well as pharmaceutical activities of Centella asiatica (L.), one of the most valuable medicinal plants, divulge the presence of secondary metabolites called Centellosides. Despite well-studied pharmaceutical activities, not much is known about the genes responsible for the synthesis of these compounds. In the present study, the full-length DXR gene sequence (JQ965955) of Centella submitted in NCBI was characterized using various bioinformatics tools and tissue specific differential expression studies were also carried out. The full-length CDNA of CaDXR contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 1425 bp which encodes a peptide of 474 amino acids. The molecular weight of this protein was found to be 51.5 kDa with isoelectric point of 6.33. The protein contains three conserved domain, namely NADPH (GSTGSIGT and LAAGSNV), substrate binding (LPADSEHSAI and NKGLEVIEAHY) and Cys-Ser-(Ala/Met/Val/Thr) cleavage-site domains. Phylogenetic studies of CaDXR sequence show close homology with DXR sequence of Angelica sinensis and Daucus carota subsp sativus as they all belong to Apiaceae family. In silico analysis predicted that CaDXR protein contains 21 α-helix and 11 β-sheets and further DXR protein model was validated by Ramachandran plot analysis. The results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations unveil dynamic stability of the proposed model and docking studies suggest that the NDP cofactor tightly binds in the active site of the protein with a strong network of hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. The expression studies by semi-RT followed by qRT-PCR suggests that CaDXR is differentially expressed in different tissues (with maximal expression in the node and lowest in the roots). Thus, characterization and structure-function analysis of DXR gene in Centella facilitate us to understand not only the functions of DXR gene but also regulatory mechanisms involved in the MEP pathway in C. asiatica plant at the molecular level.,Supplementary information:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-021-02723-w.",

The contents of total flavonoids, phenolics, and saponins were quantified.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The anti-inflammatory effects of Penyanling were observed on PID rats, such as suppressing the infiltrations of lymphocytes and neutrophils in the uterine tube, decreasing the release of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and promoting the production of lipoxin A4 (LXA4). On the other hand, Penyanling regulated the activity of NF-κB signal pathway on the LPS-stimulated THP-1 cell line, which suggested the potential mechanism of its anti-inflammatory effect. Besides, it could promote the expression of formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), which suggested its effect on enhancing the resolution of inflammation. Seventy-six substances were identified by their accurate molecular weights, mass fragment patterns, retention times, and standards if available. Most of these substances were flavonoids, phenolics, saponins, and alkaloids. The contents of total flavonoids, phenolics, and saponins within Penyanling were 0.186, 1.371, and 4.321 mg/mL, respectively.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Penyanling showed an anti-inflammatory effect on PID, and its potential mechanism involved suppressing NF-κB signal pathway and promoting the resolution of inflammation. The main substances within it were flavonoids, phenolics, saponins, and alkaloids.",

In this study, we aimed to explore the analgesia effect of HXZT on MIA-induced osteoarthritis rat and the underlying mechanisms. The analgesia and anti-inflammatory effect of HXZT on osteoarthritis in vivo were tested by the arthritis model rats induced by monosodium iodoacetate (MIA).. Mechanistic studies confirmed that HXZT could inhibit the activation of NF-κB and down-regulate the mRNA expression of related inflammatory factors in LPS-induced RAW264.7 and ATDC5 cells. Furtherly, in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells, HXZT could suppress NF-κB via inhibiting PI3K/Akt pathway.

            "content": "Dried roots of the plants Acanthopanax senticosus, Angelica sinensis and Scutellaria baicalensis are used in traditional oriental medicine and reportedly possess anti-inflammatory properties. Using the murine air pouch model of inflammation, we investigated the efficacy and mode of action of an extract from these three plants in crystal-induced inflammation. Air pouches were raised on the backs of 8-week-old BALB/c mice. Mice were fed 100 mg/kg body weight of root extracts (A. senticosus:A. sinensis:S. baicalensis mixed in a ratio of 5:4:1 by weight) or vehicle only on days 3-6. Inflammation was elicited on day 6 by injecting 2 mg of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals into the pouch. Neutrophil density and IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA levels were determined in the pouch membrane, and the leukocyte count and IL-6, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) levels were determined in the pouch exudate. Treatment with the root extracts led to a reduction in all inflammatory parameters: the leukocyte count in the pouch exudate decreased by 82%; the neutrophil density in the pouch membrane decreased by 68%; IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA levels in the pouch membrane decreased by 100%; the IL-6 concentration in the pouch fluid decreased by 50%; and the PGE2 concentration in the pouch fluid decreased by 69%. Remarkably, the concentration of the potentially anti-inflammatory PGD2 rose 5.2-fold in the pouch exudate (p < 0.005), which led to a normalization of the PGD2:PGE2 ratio. A 3.7-fold rise in hematopoietic PGD synthase (h-PGDS) mRNA paralleled this rise in PGD2 (p = 0.01). Thus, the root extracts diminished MSU crystal-induced inflammation by reducing neutrophil recruitment and expression of pro-inflammatory factors and increasing the level of the potentially anti-inflammatory PGD2. These results support a need for further studies of the efficacy of these extracts in the treatment of inflammatory arthropathies and suggest elevation of PGD2 levels as a novel mechanism for an anti-inflammatory agent.",

            "content": "Vascular dementia (VaD), the second cause of dementia, is caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, producing progressive damage to cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and white matter. Ligustilide (LIG), one of the main active ingredients of Angelica sinensis, exerts the neuroprotective effect on neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism remains unclear. An in vivo model of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion and in vitro model of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) were employed in this study. LIG (20 or 40 mg/kg/day) was intragastrically administered to the VaD rats for four weeks. The results of the Morris water maze test demonstrated that LIG effectively ameliorated learning and memory deficiency in VaD rats. LIG obviously relieved neuronal oxidative stress damage by increasing the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and decreasing the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in VaD rats. Nissl staining showed that LIG increased the number of the Nissl body in VaD rats. After LIG administration, the apoptotic-related protein, Bax, was decreased and Bcl-2 was increased in the hippocampus of VaD rats. Moreover, the expressions of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) were decreased, binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP) and phospho-inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (P-IRE1α), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s), and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) were increased in VaD rats. After LIG treatment, these changes were reversed. The immunofluorescence results further showed that LIG upregulated the expression of SIRT1 and downregulated the expression of P-IRE1α in VaD rats. In addition, in vitro experiment showed that EX-527 (SIRT1 inhibitor) partly abolished the inhibitory effect of LIG on the IRE1α/XBP1s/CHOP pathway. In conclusion, these studies indicated that LIG could improve cognitive impairment by regulating the SIRT1/IRE1α/XBP1s/CHOP pathway in VaD rats.",

            "content": "Ageing is associated with impaired repair mechanisms in cardiovascular diseases. Macrophages contribute to cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction (MI). The phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway has been shown to play a role in cardiac remodelling after MI. It remained unclear whether n-butylidenephthalide, a major component of Angelica sinensis, can attenuate cardiac fibrosis by regulating the PI3K/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-mediated macrophage phenotypes in ageing rats after MI. Twenty-four hours after ligation of the left anterior descending artery, young (2-month-old) and ageing (18-month-old) male Wistar rats were treated with either vehicle or n-butylidenephthalide for 4 weeks. There were similar infarct sizes in both age groups. Compared with young rats, ageing rats exhibited significant increased cardiac fibrosis after MI, which can be attenuated after administering n-butylidenephthalide. MI was associated with decreased activities of PI3K and STAT3 in ageing rats compared with young rats. In both age groups, n-butylidenephthalide effectively provided a significant increase of STAT3 phosphorylation, STAT3 activity, STAT3 nuclear translocation, myocardial IL-10 levels and the percentage of M2c macrophage and a decrease of myofibroblast infiltration. The effects of n-butylidenephthalide on increased IL-10 levels were reversed by LY294002 or S3I-201. Furthermore, LY294002 abolished the STAT3 phosphorylation, whereas PI3K activity was not affected following the inhibition of STAT3. In conclusions, the host environment is responsible for ageing-related myofibroblast dysregulation in response to MI which can be improved by administering n-butylidenephthalide via macrophage differentiation towards M2 phenotype by targeting the PI3K/STAT3 axis.",

            "content": "Plant polyphenols can form functional coatings on various materials through self-polymerization. In this paper, a series of modified capillary columns, which possess diversity of charge characteristics for modulating electroosmotic flow (EOF), were prepared by one-step co-deposition of gallic acid (GA), a plant-derived polyphenol monomer, and branched polyethyleneimine (PEI). The physicochemical properties of the prepared columns were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV-Vis spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The magnitude and direction of EOF of GA/PEI co-deposited columns were modulated by changing a series of coating parameters, such as post-incubation of FeCl3, co-deposition time, and deposited amounts of GA and PEI with different relative molecular mass (PEI-600, PEI-1800, PEI-10000, and PEI-70000). Furthermore, the separation efficiencies of the prepared GA/PEI co-deposited columns were evaluated by separations of small molecules, including organic acids, polar nucleotides, phenols, nucleic acid bases and nucleosides. Results indicated that modulating of EOF plays an important role in enhancing the separation performance and reversing the elution order of the analytes. Finally, the developed method was successfully applied to quantitative analysis of acidic compounds in four real samples. The recoveries were in the range of 73.5%-85.8% for citric acid, benzoic acid, sorbic acid, salicylic acid and ascorbic acid in beverage and fruit samples, 101.6%-104.9% for cinnamic acid, vanillic acid, and ferulic acid in Angelica sinensis sample, while 84.6%-97.8% for guanosine-5'-monophosphate, uridine-5'-monophosphate, cytosine-5'- monophosphate and adenosine-5'-monophosphate in Cordyceps samples. These results indicated that the co-deposition of plant polyphenol-inspired GA/PEI coatings can provide new opportunities for EOF modulation of capillary electrophoresis.",

Ferulic acid-modulated cell signalling and HER2 gene expression were evaluated in MCF7 line by Western blot and real-time RT-PCR analysis.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Ferulic acid ER-dependently stimulated cell proliferation on MCF7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The HER2 oncogene (one of the prognostic factors of breast cancer) and ESR1 gene (oestrogen receptor-alpha; ERalpha) transcription were markedly up-regulated by FA treatment. Besides, HER2 signalling and its downstream molecules such as AKT and ERK1/2 were involved in FA-modulated ERalpha and cyclin D1 synthesis. Addition of anti-HER2 antibody, trastuzumab, abrogated FA-enhanced proliferative effect on MCF7 cells, indicated a positive feedback control for the action of HER2 in this setting. The fact that the ER antagonist blocked most of the FA-up-regulated HER2 expression, and that trastuzumab down-regulated ERalpha gene expression, suggested a cross-talk between ERalpha and HER2 signalling on MCF7 cells.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The authors' conclude that FA causes human breast cancer cell proliferation by up-regulation of HER2 and ERalpha expression.",

Modern phytochemical studies showed that Z-ligustilide (LIG) is the main lipophilic component of Danggui. In this study, we examined whether LIG could protect ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury by minimizing oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis. Transient forebrain cerebral ischemia (FCI) was induced by the bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion for 30 min. LIG was intraperitoneally injected to ICR mice at the beginning of reperfusion. As determined via 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining at 24 h following ischemia, the infarction volume in the FCI mice treated without LIG (22.1 +/- 2.6%) was significantly higher than that in the FCI mice treated with 5 mg/kg (11.8 +/- 5.2%) and 20 mg/kg (2.60 +/- 1.5%) LIG (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). LIG treatment significantly decreased the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activities of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the ischemic brain tissues (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 vs. FCI group). In addition, LIG provided a great increase in Bcl-2 expression as well as a significant decrease in Bax and caspase-3 immunoreactivities in the ischemic cortex. The findings demonstrated that LIG could significantly protect the brain from damage induced by transient forebrain cerebral ischemia. The antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties of LIG may contribute to the neuroprotective potential of LIG in cerebral ischemic damage.",

After extraction from blood, the analytes and internal standard were subjected to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with a Shim-pack XR-ODS column (75 × 3.0 mm(2) , 2.2 μm particles) and mobile phase was composed of methanol and water (containing 0.05% formic acid) under gradient elution conditions, with an electrospray ionization source in the positive ionization and multiple reaction monitoring mode. The lower limits of quantification were 0.192-0.800 ng/mL for all the analytes. Satisfactory linearity, precision, accuracy, mean extraction recovery, and acceptable matrix effect have been achieved. The validated method was successfully applied to a comparative pharmacokinetic study of five bioactive components in rat plasma after oral administration of HLXLD or DG-CX alone, respectively, between normal and arthritic rats. The results showed that there were unlike characters of pharmacokinetics among different groups.",

            "content": "Ligustilide (LIG) is a principal active ingredient of traditional Chinese medicine, Radix Angelica sinensis, which has versatile pharmacological activities including neuroprotection. Previous studies have demonstrated that LIG has beneficial effects on cognition deficits associated with cerebral damage or neurodegenerative disorders. In present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of LIG on cognitive impairment and neurotoxicity in the brain of aging mouse induced by d-galactose (d-gal). The aging model mice were induced by subcutaneous (S.C.) injection of d-gal once daily for 8 weeks and LIG (80 mg/kg) was simultaneously administered orally. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to assess the spatial learning and memory abilities. The activity of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and the content of lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) in brain were examined. The levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), growth-associated protein GAP-43, and cleaved caspase-3 in brain were also determined by immunohistochemistry. The MWM test showed that LIG administration markedly improved behavioral performance of d-gal treated mice. This action could be partly explained by the results that LIG reduced the level of MDA as well as increased the activity of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in the brain of d-gal induced aging mice. Moreover, LIG significantly raised the expression of GAP-43 and reduced cleaved caspase-3 and GFAP levels in the brain of d-gal treated mice. These results demonstrated that LIG improves d-gal-induced cognitive dysfunction and brain toxicity, which suggests that LIG may be developed as a new medicine for the treatment of aged-related conditions.",

Chinese herbal medicine has its own theory for amenorrhea caused by antipsychotic drugs and has developed its own medication methods.,Aim of the study:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      To review and conduct meta-analysis of the use of traditional Chinese herbal medicine in treatment of amenorrhea caused by antipsychotic drugs.,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      A search was conducted across seven Chinese electronic databases (the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, the China Science and Technology Journal Database, the Wanfang Database, the SinoMed, the Foreign Medical Literature Retrieval Service(FMRS), the Chinese University of Hong Kong Library, the Airiti Library), and the following English databases: MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, OLD MEDLINE、Publisher Supplied Citation in pubmed; JBI EBP Database, EBM Reviews, Embase, OVID Emcare, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Maternity & Infant Care Database(MIDIRS), APA PsycInfo in OVID, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Cochrane Reviews), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (Other Reviews), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Clinical Trials),The Cochrane Methodology Register (Method Studies), Health Technology Assessment Database (Technology Assessments), NHS Economic Evaluation Database (Economic Evaluations) in Cochrane Library; and four databases (Science Direct, ProQuest, Web of Science, and Scopus) in official website using common standards and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The remaining reports were used for preliminary studies. Due to inconsistencies in control groups, randomized controlled trials and articles that combined with other drugs were also excluded. This study is a META analysis of a single rate.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Initial screening returned 912 potentially relevant publications in all databases. After subsequent filtering, a total of 18 articles were included in the analysis. The overall effectiveness for treatment amenorrhea caused by antipsychotic drugs using traditional Chinese herbal medicine was 0.91, with 95% confidence interval of 0.89-0.93. Notably in most studies, the time needed to achieve this level of effectiveness was relatively long, usually in excess of three months. Although a satisfactory verification of an improvement in menstrual cycling takes time, the long treatment duration is a downside. Our analysis revealed that the following Chinese herbal remedies were most common: Danggui (Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels), Chuanxiong (Ligusticum striatum DC.), Taoren (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch), Honghua (Carthamus tinctorius L.), Gancao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.), Fuling ((Fungus) Poria cocos (Schw.)

DC.(Processed), Baishao (Cynanchum otophyllum C.K.Schneid.) CONCLUSIONS: Chinese herbal medicine can effectively treat amenorrhea caused by psychiatric drugs, although it takes a long time to achieve satisfactory effectiveness. More research is needed to better understand different aspects of Chinese herbal medicine use in treatment of this particular medical condition.",

This research was designed to study the effect of structural changes through fungal biotransformation on the reported biological activities of isoepoxypteryxin. Among the tested microorganisms, only Cordyceps sinensis had enzymes that could catalyze the ester hydrolysis and the reductive cleavage of the epoxide ring of isoepoxypteryxin, separately, to give two more polar metabolites (+)-cis-khellactone (P1) and a new coumarin derivative (+)-cis-3'-[(2-methyl-3-hydroxybutanoyl)oxy]-4'-acetoxy-3',4'-dihydroseselin (P2), respectively. The polar metabolite P2 showed stronger cytotoxicity and higher selectivity than isoepoxypteryxin. On the molecular level, P2 showed more in vitro inhibition of both tubulin polymerization and histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8). Similarly, P2 showed more neuroprotection against amyloid beta fragment 1 - 42 (Aβ1 - 42 )-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) and exhibited more inhibition of the in vitro aggregation of Aβ1 - 42 . Both metabolites showed stronger antiplatelet aggregation by increased inhibition of thromboxane-A2 synthase (TXS) activity and thromboxane-A2 (TXA2) production. This study is the first to describe the improved cytotoxic, neuroprotective, and antiplatelet aggregation activities of isoepoxypteryxin through its biotransformation by C. sinensis.",

            "content": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic cutaneous disorder that is characterized by severe eczematous inflammation, swelling, and lichenification. Activation of T helper (Th)-22 cells by allergens leads to epidermal hyperplasia with hyperkeratosis at the chronic phase of AD. Derma-Hc is composed of five natural herbs with anti-AD effects, such as Astragalus membranaceus BUNGE, Schizonepeta tenuifolia Briq., Cryptotympana pustulata Fabr., Angelica sinensis Diels, Arctium lappa L. In this study, the ameliorative effect of Derma-Hc on cutaneous lichenification in 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzne (DNCB)-induced AD was investigated. The dorsal skin of mice was sensitized with DNCB to induce AD-like skin lesions. The dermatitis score and frequency of scratching were evaluated. Thickness of epidermis and dermis was measured by staining with H&E. In addition, infiltration of the mast cell was observed by staining with toluidine blue. Then, desmosomal cadherin, DSC1 was examined by immunofluorescence. Pathological mechanisms involved in lichenification were analyzed in AD-like skin lesions and TNF-α + IFN-γ-treated with human keratinocytes including keratinocyte differentiation genes and JAK1-STAT3 signaling pathway with IL-22 by RT-PCR and western blotting. Topical treatment of Derma-Hc improved AD-like symptoms such as dryness, edema and lichenefication and decreased the number of scratches. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that Derma-Hc significantly inhibited epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, and mast cells infiltration. In addition, the level of DSC1 was highly expressed in the epidermis by Derma-Hc. Moreover, mRNA expression level of FLG, an epidermal differentiation complex gene, was recovered by Derma-Hc treatment. KLK5 and KLK7 were markedly reduced to normalize keratinocyte differentiation in dorsal skin tissues and human keratinocytes. On the other hand, Derma-Hc restored expression level of SPINK5. In addition, Derma-Hc inhibited IL-22 via the blockade of JAK1-STAT3 signal pathway. Taken together, Derma-Hc, a natural herbal formula, regulated keratinocyte differentiation and inhibited epidermal hyperplasia with hyperkeratosis. Therefore, Derma-Hc could be a promising candidate for treating chronic AD through modulating signaling of IL-22-associated skin lichenification.",

            "content": "Angelica sinensis (AS; Dang Gui), a traditional Chinese herb, has for centuries been used for the treatment of bone diseases, including osteoporosis and osteonecrosis. However, the effective ingredient and underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we identified guaiacol as the active component of AS by two-dimensional cell membrane chromatography/C18 column/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (2D CMC/C18 column/TOFMS). Guaiacol suppressed osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function in bone marrow monocytes (BMMCs) and RAW264.7 cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Co-immunoprecipitation indicated that guaiacol blocked RANK-TRAF6 association and RANK-C-Src association. Moreover, guaiacol prevented phosphorylation of p65, p50, IκB (NF-κB pathway), ERK, JNK, c-fos, p38 (MAPK pathway) and Akt (AKT pathway), and reduced the expression levels of Cathepsin K, CTR, MMP-9 and TRAP. Guaiacol also suppressed the expression of nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1(NFATc1) and the RANKL-induced Ca2+ oscillation. In vivo, it ameliorated ovariectomy-induced bone loss by suppressing excessive osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, our findings suggest that guaiacol inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by blocking the interactions of RANK with TRAF6 and C-Src, and by suppressing the NF-κB, MAPK and AKT signalling pathways. Therefore, this compound shows therapeutic potential for osteoclastogenesis-related bone diseases, including postmenopausal osteoporosis.",

We investigated the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in reducing the overall, diabetes-related, and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)-related mortalities among patients with HHAs using a nationwide population database. In total, we identified 33,278 patients with HHAs and included 9,222 non-CHM and 9,222 CHM matched pairs after matching. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the risk of mortality between non-CHM and CHM users. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to compare the cumulative incidence mortality between non-CHM and CHM users. The CHM prescription patterns were presented by the association rules and network analyses, respectively.

            "content": "Being a potential candidate for stroke treatment, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BM-MSCs) have been demonstrated to be able to enhance angiogenesis and proliferation of reactive astrocytes, which subsequently leads to the amelioration of neurological injury. Increasing evidence further indicates that combining BM-MSCs with certain agents, such as simvastatin, may improve therapeutic effects. Sodium ferulate (SF) and n-butylidenephthalide (BP), two main components of Radix Angelica Sinensis, are proven to be important regulators of stem cells in cell migration, differentiation, and pluripotency maintenance. This study aimed to investigate whether combining BM-MSCs with SF and BP had better therapeutic effect in the treatment of stroke, and the underlying molecular basis for the therapeutic effects was also investigated. The results showed that combination treatment notably reduced neurological injury after stroke and increased the expression of astrocyte-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and von Willebrand factor-positive vascular density in the ischemic boundary zone as evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. After treatment with BM-MSCs plus SF and BP, astrocytes showed increased expression of VEGF and BDNF by upregulating protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR) expression in an oxygen- and glucose-deprived (OGD) environment. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) incubated with the conditioned medium (CM) derived from OGD astrocytes treated with BM-MSCs plus SF and BP showed significantly increased migration and tube formation compared with those incubated with the CM derived from OGD astrocytes treated with BM-MSCs alone. These results demonstrate that combination treatment enhances the expression of astrocyte-derived VEGF and BDNF, which contribute to angiogenesis after cerebral ischemia, and the underlying mechanism is associated with activation of the astrocytic AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Our study provides a potential therapeutic approach for ischemic stroke.",

            "content": "Background:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Jingshu Keli (JSKL), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula consisting of multiple active compounds, has been officially approved by National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for treatment of cervical radiculopathy. It relieves pain, according to TCM theory, by activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis. The pain mainly stems from neurogenic inflammation caused by mechanical compression of the cervical nerve root. In addition, inflammation mediators also cause the development of other joint diseases, such as osteoarthritis (OA). The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of JSKL and identify the biologically active herbs and compounds in vitro.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) was used to determine the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8), in the culture medium of human MH7A cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS).,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      JSKL and three single-herb capsules, Cinnamomum cassia Presl (C.C.), Angelica Sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (A.S.) and Carthamus tinctorius L. (C.T.), significantly inhibited the secretion of TNF-α. If one of these three herbal components was removed, suppressing effect of the single-herb-deleted JSKL on TNF-α was abolished. Cinnamaldehyde (CIN) from C.C. was the most potent ingredient that inhibited the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in the culture medium of both LPS-stimulated MH7A cells and primary synovial cells.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      JSKL was found to possess anti-inflammatory effect in vitro; C.C., A.S. and C.T. were the principal and essential herbal components responsible for such activity; CIN from C.C. is one the most potent single compound among indicator components of JSKL recorded in 2015 Chinese pharmacopoeia. This study provided scientific evidence for the clinical application of JSKL as an agent for targeted treatment of cervical radiculopathy. Furthermore, CIN has potential to be used for the treatment of some inflammation-related orthopedic diseases, such as rheumatic arthritis and osteoarthritis.",

Mitochondrial functions of were detected by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence, and mitochondrial fission were detected by western blots. Furthermore, we studied the role of AMPK pathway in the neuroprotective effect of LIG.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      LIG treatment significantly increased the MMP and ATP production, decreased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and Ca2+ overload, and further induced mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. Moreover, we found that blocking mitochondrial fission by mdivi-1 resulted in accumulation of damaged mitochondria mainly through selectively blocking mitophagy, thereby inhibiting viability of HT-22 cells after OGD/R. Also, Drp-1 inhibitor mdivi-1 increased the infarct volume and aggravated the neurological deficits after MCAO operation in vivo. Additionally, LIG triggered AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. AMPKα2 knockdown attenuated LIG-induced mitochondrial fission through inhibiting the expression of Drp1 and Fis1, and led to nerve cell apoptosis.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Our study indicate that LIG attenuated the injury of ischemic stroke by improving mitochondrial function and highlight the critical role of LIG in the regulation of LIG-induced mitochondrial fission and mitophagy via an AMPK-dependent manner.

The energy charge and phosphocreatine, activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes, mitochondrial membrane potential, activity of Na(+)-K(+) ATPase and the expression levels of Bcl-2 and Bax in the brains were measured, respectively. TXET exhibits significant protection on mitochondrial function and energy supply in addition to ameliorating cognitive decline in APPswe/PS1De9 mice. TXET rescues mitochondrial function by increasing the mitochondrial membrane potential, energy charge levels, activity of respiratory chain complexes and Na(+)-K(+) ATPase activity.

(E)-ferulic acid (FA) is an important active ingredient of Angelica spp., including A. sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, and has been suggested as a marker for quality evaluation of those crude drugs. However, it has been controversial whether FA is a reliable marker constituent of A. acutiloba. To achieve effective extraction of FA from A. acutiloba, we compared three different extraction methods: alkaline hydrolysis, ethanol extraction, and hexane extraction. FA levels in these extracts were assessed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and alkaline hydrolysis was found to be the most effective. Furthermore, in the hydrolysate, FA was distinctly identified by thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis.

Following coarctation, rats were given SF (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/day) for 25 consecutive days. We characterized myocardial hypertrophy using myocardial hypertrophic parameters, histopathology, and gene expression of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) -a gene related to myocardial hypertrophy.

Notably, coarctation of the abdominal aorta increases myocardial hypertrophic parameters, cardiac myocyte diameter, the concentration of Ang II and ET-1 in myocardium, and gene expression of ANF. SF significantly ameliorates myocardial hypertrophy caused by coarctation of the abdominal aorta; reduces concentrations of Ang II and ET-1; suppresses the overexpression of ANF, PKC-β, Raf-1, and ERK1/2; and increases the expression of MKP-1.

The original process was inefficient; maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) and iPS cell cultures required an expensive reagent-leukemia induced factor (LIF). Our goal is to find a pure compound that not only maintains ES and iPS cell pluripotency, but also increases iPS cell generation efficiency. From 15 candidate compounds we determined that 10 µg/ml n-Butylidenephthalide (BP), an Angelica sinensis extract, triggers the up-regulation of Oct4 and Sox2 gene expression levels in MEF cells. We used ES and iPS cells treated with different concentrations of BP to test its usefulness for maintaining stem cell pluripotency. Results indicate higher expression levels of several stem cell markers in BP-treated ES and iPS cells compared to controls that did not contain LIF, including alkaline phosphatase, SSEA1, and Nanog. Embryoid body formation and differentiation results confirm that BP containing medium culture was capable of maintaining ES cell pluripotency after six time passage. Microarray analysis data identified PPAR, ECM, and Jak-Stat signaling as the top three deregulated pathways. We subsequently determined that phosphorylated Jak2 and phosphorylated Stat3 protein levels increased following BP treatment and suppressed with the Jak2 inhibitor, AG490. The gene expression levels of cytokines associated with the Jak2-Stat3 pathway were also up-regulated. Last, we used pou5f1-GFP MEF cells to test iPS generation efficiency following BP treatment. Our data demonstrate the ability of BP to maintain stem cell pluripotency via the Jak2-Stat3 pathway by inducing cytokine expression levels, at the same time improving iPS generation efficiency.",

Nevertheless, the stability of systemic circulation and the effectiveness of tumor accumulation are the basis for achieving tumor subcellular targeting. This study aims to overcome the biological barrier while improving the mitochondria-targeted effect of nanoparticles based on natural polysaccharides. Novel polysaccharide-based nanoparticles, with tumor microenvironment-responsive charge-reversal and mitochondrial targeting abilities, were prepared in our study. Curcumin (Cur) was loaded into the core of a positively charged chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) derivative with mitochondrial targeting ability, and a negatively charged shell based on angelica sinensis polysaccharide (AS) derivative was wrapped in the surface of the core. At the same time, the pH-sensitive borate ester bond was formed between the shell and the core. In vitro experiments showed that mitochondrial-targeted core-shell nanoparticles achieved charge-reversal and release more Cur in the acidic tumor microenvironment. After entering into the tumor cells, the lysosomes escape was effectively realized, and more Cur was transmitted to the mitochondria. This process led to the enhancement of the cytotoxicity, the reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the activation of the apoptotic pathway. The results of in vivo experiments showed that the core-shell nanoparticles efficiently delivered the drug to the tumor site and significantly prolonged the retention time of the drug in the tumor tissue.

CP showed superiority in reducing proportions of pro-inflammatory immune cells M1 cells, neutrophils, Th1 and Th17 cells, and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α. In the contrast, AZ had advantage of elevating ratios of anti-inflammatory immune cells M2 and Treg cells as well as the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β. In addition, CP and AZ synergistically regulated M1/M2 macrophage polarization and the following IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ production, thereby restoring intestinal mucosal barrier.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Taken together, our study first demonstrated that cold-natured medicine CP and hot-natured medicine AZ took on different functions in treatment of colitis mice. Meanwhile, they exhibited synergistic effect on the alleviation of intestinal inflammation and reinforcement of gut barrier function and integrity.",

Finally, 1,076 ASRD users and 4,304 matched nonusers were subjected to analysis. We used Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratios for ESRD and death and Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratio of hyperkalemia. The additive effect of one to four ASRD and the pooling effect of individual ASRD on risks of ESRD and death were also addressed.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      In a total follow-up of 15,740 person-years, 2,703 patients (50.2%) developed ESRD and 499 (9.3%) died before progression to ESRD. As compared with nonusers, ASRD users were associated with adjusted hazard ratios of 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.91) for ESRD and 0.78 (0.30-0.93) for death, as well as adjusted incidence rate ratios of 0.54 (0.48-0.60) for inpatient hyperkalemia and 0.44 (0.42-0.46) for total hyperkalemia. The renal and survival benefits of ASRD use were consistent across almost patient subgroups on multivariate stratified analyses. Using all four ASRD provided the lowest risks of ESRD (0.30; 0.71-0.52) and death (0.32; 0.17-0.63). Individual use of ASRD also demonstrated comparable renal and survival benefits.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      ASRD use was associated with lower risks of ESRD and death among advanced CKD patients.

Chinese Herbal Medicines (CHMs) are expected as adjuvant therapy for immunomodulation against cancer, but face the key challenge of poor scientific evidence. Changes of natural killer (NK) cells on numbers and/or cytotoxicity are a novel respect to evaluate the immunomodulation of CHMs.,Aim of the study:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The purpose of this review is to investigate the immunomodulation of Chinese Herbal Medicines (CHMs) on NK cell populations for cancer therapy.,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      A systematic review was conducted and outside mainstream electronic databases were screened for potential reference articles.

Briefly, most of cellular studies and two thirds animal studies were based on the extract or components of single herbs, whilst most of clinical trials were keen on formula or prescription of CHMs. The main components of CHMs were demonstrated active on promoting the cytotoxicity of NK cells, including Angelica sinensis, Ganoderma lucidum, Panax ginseng, Radix Astragali, Lentinus edodes, etc. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive review demonstrated NK cells activity was positively associated with quality of life but not survival benefit of cancer patients. Thus exploring the roles of NK cells in adjuvant therapy against cancer is confirmed to be beneficial to explore the underlying relationship between immunomodulation and quality of life.",

Naoxintong is clinically effective in treating ischaemia heart disease. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-Like Receptor with a Pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been critically involved in myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Here, we have been suggested that NXT might attenuate myocardial I/R injury via suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Male C57BL6 mice were subjected to myocardial I/R injury via 45 min. coronary ligation and release for the indicated times. Naoxintong (0.7 g/kg/day) and PBS were orally administrated for 2 weeks before surgery. Cardiac function assessed by echocardiography was significantly improved in the NXT group compared to PBS group at day 2 after myocardial I/R. NLRP3 inflammasome activation is crucially involved in the initial inflammatory response after myocardial I/R injury, leading to cleaved caspase-1, mature interleukin (IL)-1β production, accompanying by macrophage and neutrophil infiltration. The cardioprotective effect of NXT was associated with a diminished NLRP3 inflammasome activation, decreased pro-inflammatory macrophage (M1 macrophages) and neutrophil infiltration after myocardial I/R injury. In addition, serum levels of IL-1β, indicators of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, were also significantly suppressed in the NXT treated group after I/R injury. Naoxintong exerts cardioprotive effects at least partly by suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in this I/R injury model.",

According to the literature, four traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbs effective for prevention cardiovascular diseases, namely Radix Salvia Miltiorrhiza (Red sage root, Danshen), Radix Pueraria Lobata (Kudzu root, Gegen), Radix Angelica Sinensis (Angelica root, Danggui), and Rhizoma Ligusticum chuanxiong (Szehuan lovage rhizome, Chuanxiong), are of high potential to be co-administered during DAPT. Since all these herbs are blood vitalizing medicines and can promote blood circulation and eliminate blood stasis, it was hypothesized that they may potentially alter the clinical outcomes of DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin.,Aim of study:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The current study is proposed aiming to preliminarily evaluate the impact of these four commonly used Chinese medicinal herbs on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin and its relevant outcomes and mechanisms.,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      In order to mimic the standard dosing regimen for DAPT in human, various Sprague-Dawley rats treatment groups were received a bolus oral dose of DAPT on day 1 followed by DAPT for consecutive 13 days in absence and presence of orally co-administered four TCM herbs (Danshen, Gegen, Danggui and Chuanxiong) at their low and high doses. On day 14, serial blood samples were collected after dosing to obtain the plasma concentrations of ASA, CLP and their corresponding metabolites by LC/MS/MS. At the end of last blood sampling point of each rat, about 4.5 ml of whole blood were collected to estimate the prothrombin time from each treatment groups. After all the blood sampling, the rats were sacrificed followed by collecting their livers for evaluations of enzyme activities and expressions in the related liver microsome preparations and stomach tissues for evaluations of their potential ulcer index. In addition, gene expression and protein levels of related biomarkers (COX-1, COX-2, P2Y12) in rat livers were measured by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively, and compared among different treatment groups.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Co-administration of Gegen and Danggui significantly altered the pharmacokinetics of ASA and CLP in DAPT with increased systemic exposure of ASA and CLP respectively. Although minimal impact on aspirin esterase activity for all co-administered herbs, significant inhibition on rCyp2c11 and carboxylesterase activities were observed for DAPT with Danshen, Gegen and Danggui co-treatment. In addition, significantly longer PT were found in all DAPT treatment groups. However, a trend of decrease in PT of DAPT in presence of Gegen, Danggui and Chuanxiong was noticed. Nevertheless, all the treatments did not cause detectable changes in COX and P2Y12 mRNA and protein expressions.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Among the four studied TCMs, it was demonstrated that co-administration of Gegen and Danggui could lead to altered pharmacokinetics of DAPT with significant inhibition on rCyp2c11 and carboxylesterase activities. Although Gegen, Danggui and Chuanxiong might potentially offset the anticoagulant activity of DAPT, the overall pharmacodynamics outcome was not considered to be harmful due to lack of risk in bleeding, which warrant further verification for its clinical impact.",

Angelica species are found on all continents of the Northern Hemisphere, and East Asia hosts the highest number of species. Morphological characters such as fruit anatomy, leaf morphology and subterranean structures of Angelica species show extreme diversity. Consequently, the taxonomic classification of Angelica species is complex and remains controversial, as the classifications proposed by previous studies based on morphological data and molecular data are highly discordant. In addition, the phylogenetic relationships of major clades in the Angelica group, particularly in the Angelica s. s. clade, remain unclear. Chloroplast (cp) genome sequences have been widely used in phylogenetic studies and for evaluating genetic diversity.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      In this study, we sequenced and assembled 28 complete cp genomes from 22 species, two varieties and two cultivars of Angelica. Combined with 36 available cp genomes in GenBank from representative clades of the subfamily Apioideae, the characteristics and evolutionary patterns of Angelica cp genomes were studied, and the phylogenetic relationships of Angelica species were resolved. The Angelica cp genomes had the typical quadripartite structure including a pair of inverted repeats (IRs: 5836-34,706 bp) separated by a large single-copy region (LSC: 76,657-103,161 bp) and a small single-copy region (SSC: 17,433-21,794 bp). Extensive expansion and contraction of the IR region were observed among cp genomes of Angelica species, and the pattern of the diversification of cp genomes showed high consistency with the phylogenetic placement of Angelica species.

Our results clearly showed that RBE caused a significant reduction in the adherence of B. abortus in both cell lines. Furthermore, analysis of phagocytic signaling proteins by western blot assay revealed that RBE pretreatment resulted in inhibition of phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38, leading to decline of internalization compared with the controls. Additionally, the intensity of F-actin observed by fluorescence microscopy and FACS was remarkably reduced in RBE-pretreated cells compared with control cells. However, the intracellular replication of B. abortus within phagocytes was not affected by RBE. Taken together, these findings suggest that the phagocytic receptor blocking and suppressive effects of RBE on the MAPK-linked phagocytic signaling pathway could negatively affect the invasion of B. abortus into phagocytes.",

The olfactory responses of S. paniceum to the most abundant volatile components of some drugstore attractant CMPMs such as Panax notoginseng, Angelica sinensis, Gastrodia elata and Peucedanum praeruptorum, namely falcarinol, 3-n-butylphthalide, p-cresol and β-pinene, respectively, were studied by electroantennography (EAG) and behavioural bioassays in six- and four-arm olfactometers.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      EAG recordings showed that male and female antennae are able to perceive the test compounds in a wide range of concentrations and in a dose-dependent manner.

Nine groups were designed, that is, normal, normal administration, model, L-arginine (L-arg 1000 μmol/L), SF (50, 100, 200 μmol/L) group, and N G -nitro-L-arg-methyl ester 1500 μmol/L combined with SF 200 μmol/L or L-arg 1000 μmol/L group, respectively. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was confirmed by observing histological changes and measurements of cell diameter, protein content and atrial natriuretic factor, and β-myosin heavy chain levels of the cells. Notably, SF could inhibit significantly myocardial hypertrophy of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in a concentration-dependent manner without producing cytotoxicity, and the levels of nitric oxide, NO synthase (NOS), endothelial NOS, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate were increased, but the level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate was decreased in cardiomyocytes. Simultaneously, levels of protein kinase C beta, Raf-1, and extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) were downregulated, whereas levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 were significantly upregulated. All the beneficial effects of SF were blunted by N G -nitro-L-arg-methyl ester. Overall, these findings reveal that SF can inhibit angiotensin II-induced myocardial hypertrophy of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, which is closely related to activation of endothelial NOS/NO/cyclic guanosine monophosphate, and inhibition of protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.",

            "content": "Background:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Historically, traditional Chinese medicine has been widely used to treat stroke. Based on the theory of Chinese medicine and the modern pharmacological knowledge of herbal medicines, we have designed a neuroprotective formula called Post-Stroke Rehabilitation (PSR), comprising seven herbs - Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge, Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, Paeonia lactiflora Pall., Cassia obtusifolia L., Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort., Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. We aim to examine the neuroprotective activity of PSR in vitro and in vivo, and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, to better understand its therapeutic effect and to further optimize its efficacy.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      PSR extract or vehicle was applied to primary rat neurons to examine their survival effects against N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-elicited excitotoxicity. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording was conducted to examine the NMDA-induced current in the presence of PSR. ERK- and CREB-activation were revealed by western blot analysis. Furthermore, PSR was tested for CRE promoter activation in neurons transfected with a luciferase reporter. The protective effect of PSR was then studied in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. MCAO rats were either treated with PSR extract or vehicle, and their neurobehavioral deficit and cerebral infarct were evaluated. Statistical differences were analyzed by ANOVA or t-test.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      PSR prominently reduced the death of cultured neurons caused by NMDA excitotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner, indicating its neuroprotective property. Furthermore, PSR significantly reduced NMDA-evoked current reversibly and activated phosphorylation of ERK and CREB with distinct time courses, with the latter's kinetics slower. PSR also triggered CRE-promoter activity as revealed by the increased expression of luciferase reporter in transfected neurons. PSR effectively reduced cerebral infarct and deficit in neurological behavior in MCAO rats when PSR decoction was administered starting either 6 days before or 6 h after onset of ischemia.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      PSR is neuroprotective both in vitro and in vivo - it protects cultured neurons against NMDA excitotoxicity, and effectively reduces ischemic injury and neurobehavioral deficit in MCAO rats in both the pre- and post-treatment regimens. The underlying neuroprotective mechanisms may involve inhibition of NMDA receptor current and activation of ERK and CREB. This study provides important preclinical data necessary for the further development of PSR for stroke treatment.",

In mammals, PINK1/Parkin is the most classic pathway mediating mitophagy. And the activation of PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy exerts neuroprotective effects during cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIRI). Ligustilide (LIG) is a natural compound extracted from ligusticum chuanxiong hort and angelica sinensis (Oliv.) diels that exerts neuroprotective activity after cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIRI). However, it still remains unclear whether LIG could attenuates cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIRI) through regulating mitophagy mediated by PINK1/Parkin.,Purpose:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      To explore the underlying mechanism of LIG on PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy in the hippocampus induced by ischemia reperfusion.,Methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      This research used the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) animal model and oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) as in vitro model. Neurological behavior score, 2, 3, 5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) Staining were used to detect the neuroprotection of LIG in MCAO/R rats. Also, the levels of ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and activities of Na+-K+-ATPase were detected to reflect mitochondrial function. Moreover, transmission electron microscope (TEM) and fluorescence microscope were used to observe mitophagy and the western blot was performed to explore the changes in protein expression in PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy. Finally, exact mechanism between neuroprotection of LIG and mitophagy mediated by PINK1/Parkin was explored by cell transfection.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The results show that LIG improved mitochondrial functions by mitophagy enhancement in vivo and vitro to alleviate CIRI. Whereas, mitophagy enhanced by LIG under CIRI is abolished by PINK1 deficiency and midivi-1, a mitochondrial division inhibitor which has been reported to have the function of mitophagy, which could further aggravate the ischemia-induced brain damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal injury.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      LIG could ameliorate the neuronal injury against ischemia stroke by promoting mitophagy via PINK1/Parkin. Targeting PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy with LIG treatment might be a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemia stroke.",

This study investigated the effects of levistilide A on liver fibrosis relating to angiogenesis, particularly on the characteristic change in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. LX-2 cells were activated by TGF-β1, and the human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HHSECs) were induced by endothelial cell growth supplement. Cell viability was detected using a methylthiazoldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay; F-actin was visualized through the fluorescence probe method; cell proliferation was examined using the EdU kit; antiangiogenesis activity was assessed using the tube formation assay and transgenic zebrafish model. To verify the results in vivo, rats were subcutaneously injected with CCl4 twice a week for six weeks to duplicate the liver fibrosis model and then treated with 10 mL/kg of normal saline, 4 mg/kg of sorafenib, and 3 and 6 mg/kg of levistilide A for three weeks from the fourth week. Collagen deposition was detected through Sirius Red staining; liver microvasculature was examined through vWF labeling and X-ray 2D imaging; sinusoidal fenestrations were observed through scanning electron microscopy; collagen I, α-SMA, CD31, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEGF-R2 were detected through Western blotting. Our results indicated that levistilide A attenuated LX-2 cell activation and HHSEC proliferation. The ability of HHSECs to form tubelike structures in Matrigel was inhibited, and the number of functional vessels in transgenic zebrafish decreased. In in vivo experiments, levistilide A reduced collagen deposition and the number of new microvessels; ameliorated sinusoid capillarization; and downregulated the expression of CD31, VEGF, and VEGF-R2. These findings suggest that levistilide A can inhibit liver fibrosis through antiangiogenesis by alleviating sinusoid capillarization via the VEGF signaling pathway. Impact statement Levistilide A has been reported to inhibit hepatic stellate cell (HSC) proliferation. In this study, we further investigated the mechanisms of levistilide A on liver fibrosis relating to angiogenesis, particularly on the characteristic change in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. The cell models of HSC and liver sinusoidal endothelial cell and CCl4 induced liver fibrosis model were used. These results suggest that levistilide A can inhibit liver fibrosis through antiangiogenesis by alleviating sinusoid capillarization via the vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway. The effect of levistilide A on liver fibrosis was confirmed, and its detailed mechanism was also discussed. These findings suggest that levistilide A may be a great potential drug for treating liver fibrosis through antiangiogenesis, and this effect will be verified in other fibrotic animal model studies or by clinical trials.",

            "content": "Dysfunction of the endothelium is regarded as an important factor in the pathogenesis of vascular disease in diabetes mellitus (DM). Unfortunately, prevention of the progression of vascular complications of DM remains pessimistic.

In the present study, we investigated the protective effects and underlying mechanism of ferulic acid and astragaloside IV against vascular endothelial dysfunction in diabetic rats. After the diabetic rat model was established using streptozotocin, sixty rats were divided into 6 groups (control, model, ferulic acid, astragaloside IV, ferulic acid + astragaloside IV, and metformin) and treated for 10 weeks. Blood samples were collected to measure levels of hemoglobin A1c (HbAlc), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), low density lipoproteins (Ox-LDL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatinine (Cr), nitric oxide (NO) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and abdominal aorta tissue samples were collected for observing histological morphology changes of endothelium and detecting gene and protein expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) P65, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). We found that ferulic acid combined with astragaloside IV was capable of improving the structure of the aortic endothelium wall, attenuating the increase of HbAlc, TG, TC, LDL-C and Ox-LDL, promoting the release of NO and eNOS, and inhibiting over-activation of MCP-1, TNF-α, and NF-κB P65, without damage to liver and kidney function. In conclusion, ferulic acid combined with astragaloside IV exhibited significant protective effects against vascular endothelial dysfunction in diabetic rats through the NF-κB pathway involving decrease of Ox-LDL, increase of NO and eNOS, and activation of NF-κB P65, MCP-1 and TNF-α.",

In order to assess the genuineness of this commercial liqueur, we have prepared extracts of the three vegetable ingredients, assessed their proteomes, and compared them to the one found in the aperitif. The amaro's proteome was identified via prior capture with CPLLs at two different pH values (2.2 and 4.8). Via mass spectrometry analysis of the recovered fractions, after elution of the captured populations in 4% boiling SDS, we could confirm the presence of the following: six proteins originating from honey, 11 from orange peels, 29 from G. lutea and 46 from A. officinalis (including shared species), plus 33 species which could not be attributed to the other secret ingredients, due to paucity of genomic data on plant proteins, for a total of 93 unique gene products (merging shared proteins). This fully confirmed the genuineness of the product. Considering that most of these species could be present in trace amounts, undetectable by conventional techniques, the CPLL methodology, due to its ability to enhance the signal of trace components up to 3 to 4 orders of magnitude, could represent a powerful tool for investigating the genuineness and natural origin of commercial beverages in order to protect consumers from adulterated products.",

Angelica archangelica flavone synthase I (AnFNS I) and Camellia sinensis flavonol synthase (CaFLS), both of which belong to metalloenzymes, have highly similar structures and metal catalytic cores. However, these two enzymes catalyze the same substrate to produce significantly different products. To identify the cause for the differences in the catalytic characteristics of AnFNS I and CaFLS, their protein models were constructed using homology modeling. Structural alignment and molecular docking was also used to elucidate the molecular basis of the differences observed. To analyze and verify the cause for the differences in the catalytic characteristics of AnFNS I and CaFLS, partial fragments of AnFNS I were used to replace the corresponding fragments on CaFLS, and the catalytic characteristics of the mutants were determined by bioconversion assay in E. coli and in vitro catalytic test. The results suggest that the difference in catalytic characteristics between AnFNS I and CaFLS is caused by the depth of the active pockets and the relative position of the substrate. Mutant 10 which present similar dock result with AnFNS I increased the proportion of diosmetin (a flavone) from 2.54 to 16.68% and decreased the proportion of 4'-O-methyl taxifolin (a flavanol) from 47.28 to 2.88%. It was also indicated that the atoms in the substrate molecule that determine the catalytic outcome may be H-2 and H-3, rather than C-2 and C-3. Moreover, it is speculated that the change in the catalytic characteristics at the changes relative spatial position of H-2/H-3 of hesperetin and the loaded carbonyl iron, caused by charged residues at the entrance of the active pocket, is the key factor for the biosynthesis of flavone from flavanone.",

Here, we employed an extracellular flux analyzer to evaluate the mitochondrial respiration of cultured H9C2 cardiomyoblasts in present of DBT. The herbal extract of DBT was qualified chemically for the major ingredients, i.e. astragaloside, calycosin, formononetin, Z-ligustilide, and ferulic acid. The anti-oxidant activities of DBT, as well as its major ingredients, were determined by Folin-Ciocalteu assay, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay, and protective effect in tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-treated cultured cardiomyoblasts. In addition, a real-time oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in herbal extract-treated cultured cardiomyoblasts was revealed by using a Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer. In addition, the transcript expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PCG-1α) and other genes relating to mitochondria biogenesis were determined in cardiomyoblasts under different herbal treatments. DBT possessed the strongest anti-oxidant activity and protective effects on the oxidatively stressed cardiomyoblasts. By revealing the OCR in mitochondria, the health state of cultured cardiomyoblasts under DBT was improved via increase of basal respiration, proton leak, non-mitochondria, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Furthermore, the transcriptional activities of genes responsible for mitochondrial biogenesis and DNA replication were stimulated by application of DBT in cultures.",

In this paper, we quantified seven main bio-active components (hydroxysafflor yellow A, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, ferulic acid, 3-n-butylphthalide, and ligustilide) in plasma samples in vivo by UPLC-TQ/MS method and investigatedwhether the pharmacokinetic (PK) behaviors of the seven components could be altered in blood stasis rats after oral administration of the Gui-Hong extracts. It was found that the Cmax and AUC0-t of these components in blood stasis rats had increasing tendency compared with normal rats. Most components in model and normal rats had significant difference in some pharmacokinetic parameters, which indicated that the metabolism enzymes and transporters involved in the metabolism and disposition of these bio-active componentsmay bealtered in blood stasis rats. This study was the first report about the pharmacokinetic investigation between normal and blood stasis rats after oral administrationof Gui-Hong extracts, and these results are important and valuable for better clinical applications of Gui-Hong herb pair and relatedTCM formulae.",

            "content": "The commonly used Angelica herbal decoction today is Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT), which is a dietary supplement in treating menopausal irregularity in women, i.e. to nourish \"Qi\" and to enrich \"Blood\". According to historical record, many herbal decoctions were also named DBT, but the most popular formulation of DBT was written in Jin dynasty (1247 AD) of China, which contained Astragali Radix (AR) and Angelicae Sinensis Radix (ASR) with a weight ratio of 5:1. However, at least two other Angelica herbal decoctions recorded as DBT were prescribed in Song (1155 AD) and Qing dynasties (1687 AD). Although AR and ASR are still the major components in the DBT herbal decoctions, they are slightly varied in the herb composition. In order to reveal the efficiency of different Angelica herbal decoctions, the chemical and biological properties of three DBT herbal extracts were compared. Significantly, the highest amounts of AR-derived astragaloside III, astragaloside IV, calycosin and formononetin and ASR-derived ferulic acid were found in DBT described in 1247 AD: this preparation showed stronger activities in osteogenic, estrogenic and erythropoetic effects than the other two DBT. The current results supported the difference of three DBT in chemical and biological properties, which could be a result of different herbal combinations. For the first time, this study supports the popularity of DBT described in 1247 AD.",

Dissertations were also searched, and eligible dissertations were selected. Studies related to the identification of constituents, bioactive components and their targets of action or pathways, clinical trials, and animal or cellular experiments that explored pharmacological mechanisms were manually selected. The quality of reporting and methodology of the included pharmacological experiments were assessed using the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines and the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE)'s risk of bias tool.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      A total of 108 relative studies were eventually included, containing 12 bioactivity research studies, 10 systematic reviews on clinical trials and 86 animal or cellular experiments. We noted that as identification methods progressed, further constituents could be detected in XBJ. XBJ was also found to have \"multi-ingredient, multi-target and multi-pathway\" effects. The systematic review revealed that XBJ could improve the 28-day mortality and other indexes, such as the APACHE II score, body temperature, and white blood cell (WBC) count, to some extent. A major organ protection effect was demonstrated in septic rats. Pharmacological investigations suggested that XBJ acts in both the early and late stages of sepsis by anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulation, immune regulation, vascular endothelial protection, anti-oxidative stress and other mechanisms. However, most of the included studies were poorly reported, and the risk of bias was unclear.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      With respect to the multiple therapeutic mechanisms contributing to both the early and late stages of sepsis, the multiple effective constituents detected and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed to prove its efficacy, XBJ is a promising therapy for the treatment of sepsis. However, although XBJ has shown some efficacy for the treatment of sepsis, there are currently some scientific gaps. More studies concerning the pharmacokinetics, interactions with antibiotics, real-world efficacy and safety, pharmacological mechanisms of the bioactive components and large-scale clinical trials should be conducted in the future.",

This trial was carried out to further evaluate the effect of the herbal powder on the subsequent fertility of Holstein dairy cows with retained placenta. The animals were treated with herbal powder (n = 85, 0.5 g crude herb/kg bw, p.o.) once daily for 1-3 day(s) or ceftiofur hydrochloride (n = 72, 2.2 mg/kg bw, i.m.) twice daily for 3 consecutive days, and 75 cows with no clinically visible pathological conditions, given without assistance and with no retained placenta diagnosis were included into the control group.

This study sought to determine ligustilide's effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Ligustilide significantly suppressed the production of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The inhibition of NO was concomitant with a decrease in the protein and mRNA levels of LPS-induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Furthermore, activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in the nucleus and the cytosolic degradation of IκBα were abrogated by ligustilide. Ligustilide also inhibited the phosphorylation of IκB kinase (IKK) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The intracellular reactive oxygen species (iROS) level was also significantly decreased. These results suggest that ligustilide exhibits anti-inflammatory activities by blocking the activation of MAPKs/IKK and the downstream transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB, which may result from ligustilide's down-regulation of iROS production.",

            "content": "Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is an economically important crop in China. In June 2021, a root rot disease was observed on tobacco (cv. Yunyan99) in Lushi, Mianchi, and Luoning counties of western Henan, China. Diseased tobacco plants exhibited wilting with leaf chlorosis and root rot accompanied by purplish to brown vascular discoloration. The symptoms were observed in four surveyed fields, 57 ha in total, and disease incidence ranged from 21 to 56%. Five symptomatic plants with leaf chlorosis and root rot were randomly collected from each field for pathogen isolation. Tissue pieces from diseased roots were surface sterilized in 75% ethanol for 30 s then rinsed with sterile distilled water three times, air dried, and placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium. Five isolates, SL1, SL2, SL3, LN and KC, were purified by single-spore culturing. On PDA, colonies grew at a rate of 2-5 mm/day and produced abundant cottony, white to pink aerial mycelia and rose pigment on the reverse side of the culture plate. From 7-day-old cultures grown on carnation leaf agar (CLA), macroconidia were straight to subarcuate, with blunt and slightly hooked apical and basal cells, had three to four septa, measured 23.4 to 44.6×3.5 to 4.2 μm (n=30). Cylindrical, napiform or oval microconidia were one to two-celled, measuring 6.3 to 22.9×2.2 to 4.9 μm (n=30). Spherical chlamydospores were intercalary or terminal, in chains. Such characteristics resembled those of the Fusarium tricinctum species comples (FTSC; Batra and Lichtwardt 1962; Leslie and Summerell 2006). To confirm the morphological diagnosis, the genomic DNA of the isolates were extracted, the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1α), RNA polymerase I largest subunit (RPB1) and second largest subunit (RPB2) genes were amplified with primers EF1/EF2, F5/G2R and 5f2/7cr respectively (O'Donnell et al. 2010), and sequenced. Maximum likelihood analysis was carried out using MEGA 7. Sequences were 97.55% to 100% identical to corresponding DNA sequences of FTSC based on GenBank and Fusarium MLST BLASTn analysis, and deposited in GenBank (ON637268.1-ON637272.1, ON637275.1-ON637279.1, ON637282.1-ON637286.1). Based on the morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analysis, the isolates were identified as F. acuminatum (SL1, SL2, SL3 and LN; Senatore et al. 2021) and F. reticulatum (KC; Moreira et al. 2019). Koch's postulates were conducted to verify the pathogenicity of individual isolates. The four-leaf stage healthy tobacco seedlings (Yunyan99, n=30) were inoculated by pouring 20 mL conidial suspension (1×107 conidia/mL) around the rhizosphere. Control seedlings were inoculated with sterilized water (n=30). All the treatments were maintained under greenhouse conditions with a 12-h light/dark photoperiod at 25±0.5℃ and 70% relative humidity for 30 days. The assay was conducted three times. Foliage chlorosis and root rot were observed on the inoculated tobacco seedlings, whereas the control seedlings remained asymptomatic after 30 days. The pathogens were reisolated from the necrotic tissue from all inoculated seedlings and were identified by sequencing partial EF-1α and RPB2 genes. Fusarium tricinctum species complex are known as an important causal of cereals Fusarium Head Blight (FHB; Laraba, et al. 2022). In China, F. acuminatum can also infect herb plants and fruits, such as Angelica sinensis, Schisandra chinensis (Ma et al. 2022; Shen et al. 2021). To our knowledge, this is the first report of root rot on tobacco caused by FTSC members in China as well as the world. This finding expands the host range known for FTSC and will be helpful for developing effective control strategies of tobacco root rot.",

DSS has been reported to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of action of DSS in vitro using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglia cells.,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      BV-2 cells were pretreated with 0.58-1.16 mg/mL of DSS for 2 h and then treated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The protein expression levels were measured by Western blots. Inflammatory factors were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The mRNA levels of inflammatory factors were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      DSS treatment at concentrations of 0.58-1.16 mg/mL resulted in no significant cytotoxicity. DSS attenuated the release of pro-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), iNOS and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in LPS-induced BV-2 cells. DSS attenuated the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TLR2, and TLR4 and decreased TLR4 and TLR protein levels as well as the phosphorylation of IκB in LPS-induced BV-2 cells. DSS also down-regulated the nuclear translocation of p65.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      This study demonstrated that DSS has a protective effect on neuroinflammation in LPS-induced BV-2 microglia cells through the TLRs/NF-κB signaling pathway.",

The primary clinical outcomes were 28-day mortality and mortality during treatment. The secondary outcomes of our study included APACHE Ⅱ scores, WBC counts, body temperature, and adverse events or reactions. We excluded low-quality studies (Jadad score < 3) and calculated risk ratios (RR) for primary outcomes with fixed effects models. We assessed quality of evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      We identified 1602 records, and 16 RCTs (1144 patients) were included. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that combined therapy reduced 28-day mortality (934/1144, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.51-0.76 P < 0.000 01, I2 = 0%), APACHE Ⅱ scores (792/1144, MD -3.53, 95% CI -4.49 to -2.54; P < 0.000 01, I2 = 59%) and body temperature (362/1144, MD -0.43, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.31; P < 0.000 01, I2 = 0%). Very low-quality evidence showed that WBC count improved with combined medication at high dosages (one study included, 40/1144, MD -8.00, 95% CI -10.18 to -5.82), but there was no reduction at moderate dosages (230/1144, MD -2.38, 95% CI -5.01 to 0.25; P = 0.08, I2 = 70%). However, moderate-quality evidence indicated positive results with low dosages (142/1144, MD -2.88, 95% CI -3.79 to -1.96; P < 0.000 01, I2 = 0%). Nevertheless, due to the insufficient number of studies and the poor quality of the current evidence, more studies of dose-effect relationships and safety concerns of XBJ are needed. Low-quality evidence showed no risk difference for mortality during treatment (210/1144, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.36-1.17; P = 0.15, I2 = 0%).,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      This study suggested that supplementation with XBJ in addition to regular treatment may improve the 28-day mortality rate, APACHE Ⅱ scores, WBC count and body temperature of sepsis patients without serious adverse events, but it may not reduce mortality during treatment, revealing a specific, remote effect of traditional Chinese medicine. However, given the high risk of bias and the low quality of the included trials, we may be unable to draw any conclusions about its routine use. Rigorously designed, multicentre, large-scale, methodologically sound trials are warranted.",

Then, we analyzed the possible molecular mechanisms for different types of natural compounds in the treatment of atherosclerosis via the protection of vascular endothelial cells from oxidative stress. In addition, perspectives for possible future studies are discussed.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      These agents with protective effects against oxidative stress in ECs mainly include phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids. Most of these agents alleviate cell apoptosis in ECs due to oxidative stress, and the mechanisms are related to Nrf2/HO-1 signaling activation. However, despite continued progress in research on various aspects of natural agents exerting protective effects against EC injury by activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling, the development of new drugs for the treatment of atherosclerosis (AS) and other CVDs based on these agents will require more detailed preclinical and clinical studies.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Our present paper provides updated information of natural agents with protective activities on ECs against oxidative stress by activating Nrf2/HO-1. We hope this review will provide some directions for the further development of novel candidate drugs from natural agents for the treatment of AS and other CVDs.",

Wolf, Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, Zingiber officinale Rosc., Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz., Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., and Mentha haplocalyx Briq. For centuries, XYS has been widely used in China for the treatment of mental disorders such as depression. However, the complicated mechanism underlying the antidepressant activity of XYS is not yet well-understood. This understanding is complicated by the sophisticated pathophysiology of depression and by the complexity of XYS, which has multiple constituents acting on different metabolic pathways. The variations of endogenous metabolites in depressed patients after administration of XYS may help elucidate the anti-depressant effect and mechanism of action of XYS. The aim of this study is to establish the metabolic profile of depressive disorder and to investigate the changes of endogenous metabolites in the depressed patients before and after the treatment of Xiaoyaosan using the dynamic analysis of urine metabolomics profiles based on (1)H NMR.,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Twenty-one depressed patients were recruited from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Shanxi Medical University. Small endogenous metabolites present in urine samples were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and analyzed by multivariate statistical methods. The patients then received XYS treatment for six weeks, after which their Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores were significantly decreased compared with their baseline scores (p≤0.01). Eight components in urine specimens were identified that enabled discrimination between the pre- and post-XYS-treated samples.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Urinary of creatinine, taurine, 2-oxoglutarate and xanthurenic acid increased significantly after XYS treatment (p≤0.05), while the urinary levels of citrate, lactate, alanine and dimethylamine decreased significantly (p≤0.05) compared with pre-treatment urine samples. These statistically significant perturbations are involved in energy metabolism, gut microbes, tryptophan metabolism and taurine metabolism.,Conclusions:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The symptoms of depression had been improved after 6 weeks׳ treatment of XYS according to evaluation of HAMD scores. The dynamic tendency of the 8 metabolites that changed significantly during the treatment of XYS is consistent with the improvement in symptoms of depression. These metabolites may be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis of depressive disorders or the evaluation of the antidepressant as well as the exploration of the mechanism of depression.",

            "content": "Ethnopharmacological relevance:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common disease in hospitalized patients, especially in critically ill patients. It is characterised with high morbidity and mortality, and is also an important cause of chronic kidney disease and chronic renal failure. Astragalus propinquus Schischkin and Panax notoginseng (A&P) compound, a famous traditional Chinese medicine, consists of Astragalus propinquus Schischkin, Panax notoginseng, Angelica sinensis, Achyranthes bidentata, and Ecklonia kurome, has been widely used for the treatment of various kidney diseases in the southwest of China. However, the effects of A&P on treatment of AKI and its underlying mechanism are needed to be uncovered.,Aim of the study:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Recent researches reported that Mincle (Macrophage-inducible C-type lectin) plays a key role in renal injury of AKI by regulating the expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines on macrophage through modulating NF-κB signaling pathway. Here, we aimed to investigate the renoprotective effect of A&P on AKI and whether by inhibiting Mincle.,Materials and methods:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      We established a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophage (BMDM) inflammatory cell model and a cisplatin-induced mouse AKI model in vitro and in vivo. Renal histopathology staining was performed to observe kidney morphology. The expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines were detected by real-time PCR and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels and Flow cytometry performed to detect polarization of macrophage.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      The results showed that A&P significantly reduced the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα and MCP-1 in LPS-stimulated BMDM cells, and secretion of IL-1β and IL-6 in supernatant. The same results were found in Cisplatin-induced AKI kidney and serum after treatment with A&P. The data also showed that A&P strongly reduced the mRNA and protein levels of Mincle in vitro and vivo, and also inhibited the activation of Syk and NF-κB. Notably, A&P down-regulated the M1 macrophage marker iNOS, which may relate to the inhibition of Mincle. Interestingly, both overexpression of Mincle by transfection of pcDNA3.1-Mincle plasmid and administration of TDB (a ligand of Mincle) can significantly abolished the A&P-inhibited inflammation in BMDM, suggesting Mincle pathway play a key role in macrophage inflammation in AKI.,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Our findings indicated that A&P protected kidney from inhibiting inflammation through down-regulating of Mincle pathway in macrophage in AKI.

            "content": "Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide and remains a major life-threatening factor in humans. Apoptosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of IHD. The Chinese herbal formula Huo Luo Xiao Ling Dan (HLXLD), one of the commonly used Chinese herbal formulas, consists of Salviae miltiorrhizae, Angelica sinensis, Gummi olibanum, and Commiphora myrrha, with a wide spectrum of pharmacological activity. However, the mechanism of action and molecular targets of HLXLD in the treatment of IHD are unclear. This study aimed to computationally predict the molecular interactions between the major active components of HLXLD and key regulators of apoptosis and then examine the effect of HLXLD on coronary artery ligation-induced acute myocardial ischemia in rats. The molecular interactions between the major active components of HLXLD, including ferulic acid, ligustilide, succinic acid, vanillic acid, tanshinone IIA, tanshinone IIB, danshensu, salvianolic acid A, salvianolic acid C, protocatechuic aldehyde, and β-boswellic acid and human protein molecules including B cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xl), B cell lymphoma 2 antagonist/killer 1 (Bak1), B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), procaspase 3, and caspase 9 with regard to hydrogen bond formation, charge interaction, and π-π stacking using Discovery Studio(®) program 3.1. The 12 HLXLD components were predicted by ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) Predictor to have favorable pharmacokinetic and low hepatotoxicity profiles. The acute myocardial ischemia was established by surgical ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The rats were divided into a sham operative group, a model group, a positive control group treated with 0.2 mg/kg isosorbide mononitrate, and groups treated with 2.7, 5.4, or 10.8 g/kg HLXLD. The results showed that administration of HLXLD increased mean arterial pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, heart rate, and maximal rate of rise/descent of left ventricular pressure levels. Administration of HLXLD significantly ameliorated coronary artery ligation-induced tissue damage in the left ventricle, with restored arrangement of myocardial fibers and recovered myoplasm in rats. Furthermore, HLXLD markedly increased the expression level of Bcl-2 but decreased the level of cleaved caspase 3. Taken together, administration of HLXLD attenuated acute myocardial ischemia-induced damage in cardiomyocytes and inhibited apoptotic death of cardiomyocytes, thereby exerting a cardioprotective effect in rats with IHD. These findings suggest that HLXLD may represent a promising herbal formula for the treatment of cardiovascular disease by counteracting apoptotic cell death via multiple active compounds. More studies are warranted to fully elucidate the mechanisms of action, identify the therapeutic targets, and validate the efficacy and safety of HLXLD in the treatment of IHD.",

FSS is mainly prescribed for patients having a deficiency of blood supply, and it indeed has been shown to stimulate the production of erythropoietin (EPO) in cultured cells. In order to reveal the mechanism of this FSS-induced EPO gene expression, the upstream regulatory cascade, via hypoxia-induced signaling, was revealed here in cultured hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hep3B. The induction of EPO gene expression, triggered by FSS, was revealed in cultured hepatocytes by: (i) the increase of EPO mRNA; and (ii) the activation of the hypoxia response element (HRE), an upstream regulator of the EPO gene. The FSS-induced EPO gene expression was triggered by an increased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α (HIF-1 α) protein; however, the mRNA expression of HIF-1 α was not altered by the treatment of FSS. The increased HIF-1 α was a result of reduced protein degradation after the FSS treatment. The current results therefore provide one of the molecular mechanisms of this ancient herbal decoction for its hematopoietic function.",

The acupoints were \"Sanyinjiao\" (SP 6), \"Zhaohai\" (KI 6), \"Huantiao\" (GB 30), \"Housanli\" (ST 36) and \"Yanglingquan\" (GB 34). 100 μL BMSCs with 1×107/mL was totally injected at the above acupoints for one rat, 20 μL an acupoint. 1.5 kg/L Chinese herbs were applied by intragastric administration, including 120 g Radix Astragali, 120 g Codonopsis, 48 g Radix Glycyrrhiza, 120 g Angelica sinensis, 120 g Blood Rattan, 48 g Achyranthes bidentata. Intragastric distilled water was used in the other non-Chinese herb groups. The expressions of α-smooth muscle actin (α-actin), latelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (CD31) and von willebrand factor (vWF) in the skeletal muscle were detected with immunohistochemical SP two-step method.,Results:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Twenty-one days after intervention, the expressions of α-actin and CD31 on the operation hind limb were higher than those on the healthy hind limb in all the groups, except the Chinese herb group (P<0.05，P<0.01). The vWF expressions on the operation side were lower than those on the healthy side in the Chinese herb group, the local injection group, the local injection + Chinese herb group and the acupoint injection + Chinese herb group (P<0.05, P<0.01). The α-actin expression on the operation side in the acupoint injection + Chinese herb group was higher than those in the normal sham operation group, DM sham operation group, the DM ischemic group and the local injection group (P<0.05, P<0.01). The CD31 expressions in the acupoint injection group, the acupoint injection + Chinese herb group, local injection + Chinese herb group were higher than those in the normal sham operation group, DM sham operation group and DM ischemic group (P<0.05, P<0.01). The CD31 expression in the acupoint injection + Chinese herb group was higher than those in the Chinese herb group and the local injection group (both P<0.05). The vWF expressions in the local injection + Chinese herb group, the acupoint injection group and the acupoint injection + Chinese herb group lower than those in the DM sham operation group and the DM ischemic group (P<0.05, P<0.01).,Conclusion:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      schemia increases the expressions of the vascular density related factors of α-actin and CD31. It is more obvious for the increasing expressions of α-actin and CD31, and decreasing expression of vWF with the interventions of simple BMSCs injection and simple Chinese herbs of benefiting qi for activating blood circulation, especially with the combination of the above tow methods. It is indicated that acupoint injection of BMSCs combined with Chinese herbs of benefiting qi for activating blood circulation can improve the angiogenesis of ischemic tissue.",

            "content": "It is well known that pain is one of the most important characteristics of migraine. Therefore, it is important and interesting to investigate the analgesic effect and mechanism of drugs which are used to treat migraine. Tou Feng Yu pill (TFY) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, consisting of the three Chinese herbal drugs Radix Angelicae dahuricae (Baizhi), Rhizome Ligustici (Chuanxiong) and Folium Camelliae sinensis (green tea) for the treatment of migraine. In this study, we found that TFY could significantly reduce the writhing times induced by acetic acid and licking foot response induced by formalin, and extend the writhing latent period. But the analgesic effect was not observed at hot-plate test. Meanwhile, experimental migrainous model induced by nitroglycerin was used to investigate the therapeutic effect of TFY. Compared with the control group, the levels of plasma calcitonin gene related to peptide (CGRP), serum nitric oxide (NO) and contents of brain dopamine (DA) in TFY administration groups were significantly decreased, and the levels of plasma endothelin (ET) and contents of brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) were remarkably increased, also the ratio of ET/NO was clearly corrected. Furthermore, the improving effect of behavior abnormality was observed in TFY administration rats. Meanwhile, isolated vascular ring test indicated that TFY had an significant effect on vasomotion, and antagonize vasospasm; moreover TFY also could increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) and reduce cerebrovascular resistance index (RI) in normal rabbits, which verified the effect of TFY on vasomotion and abnormal hemorheology. All the results indicate that TFY has an effective therapeutical action on migraine, which may be related to three aspects as following: firstly, adjusting the level of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and vasoactive substances, relieving neurogenic inflammation; secondly, improving vasomotion, increase cerebral blood flow, then improving hemorheology; finally, increasing pain threshold, relieving or preventing headache. These findings provide additional pharmacological information and may contribute for the further study and use of TFY as a phytomedicine.",

Angelica dahurica, A. pubescens, A. sinensis, Astragalus membranaceus, Coptis chinensis, Haplophyllum hispanicum, Phellodendron amurense, Poria cocos, Ranunculus sceleratus and Scutellaria baicalensis showed significant effects against the parasite with a percentage of growth inhibition between 20 and 100%. C. chinensis and R. sceleratus showed the greatest activity with IC(50) values of 1.7 microg/ml for C. chinensis and 10.7 microg/ml for R. sceleratus. These activities are greater than that of allopurinol. C. chinesis and R. sceleratus extracts did not show cytotoxic effects on rat polimorphonuclear cells using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and lactic dehydrogenase assays. These results allowed us to suggest that R. sceleratus and C. chinensis could be a source of new compounds clinically active against T. cruzi.",

The central acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activities were assessed spectrophotometrically. LIG significantly improved spatial long-term memory and short-term memory impairment, inhibited AChE activity and increased ChAT activity. Moreover, LIG and tacrine showed the comparable efficacy in both neurobehavioral and cholinergic evaluation. These data suggest that LIG may alleviate memory deficits probably via enhancing cholinergic function.",

            "content": "Xin-Sheng-Hua granule (XSHG) is a popular remedy commonly used in clinic for the treatment of lochiostasis after delivery. To comparatively investigate the roles of herb pairs containing Angelicae Sinensis Radix (Danggui) upon the formula by evaluating the blood coagulation and hemorheology function in acute blood stasis rats, acute blood stasis rat model was established by ice water bath and subcutaneous injection of adrenaline. And the blood stasis mice were administrated intragastrically with different samples of the formula minus herb pairs containing Danggui and the whole formula (XSHG, SHD, DY, DC, DT, DH, DJ and DZ). The whole blood viscosity (WBV), plasma viscosity (PV), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and haematocrit (HCT) were applied to evaluate the effects of the formula minus herb pairs containing Danggui on hemorheology of blood stasis rats. The thrombin time (TT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), and plasma fibrinogen (FIB) were used to observe the effects of the formula minus herb pairs containing Danggui on blood coagulation function of blood stasis rats. Additionally, the maximum aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was tested to observe the effect of different samples on platelet aggregation index of blood stasis rats.Afterwards, multi-attribute comprehensive index methods and principal component analysis were both applied to comprehensively assess the total effects of the formula minus herb pairs containing Danggui on promoting blood circulation and dissipating blood stasis. Compared with normal group, the hemorheological parameters and coagulation indexes of model group had statistical differences (P<0.01). Compared with model group, different samples (XSHG, SHD, DY, DC, DT, DH, DJ and DZ) could improve the blood hemorheology indexes, coagulation parameters and platelet aggregation in acute blood stasis rats. According to multi-attribute comprehensive index methods and the principal component analysis, the effects of promoting blood circulation by removing blood stasis became poor when excluding herb pairs containing Danggui from the formula, the sample DY and DC had the weakest effect of activating blood circulation and dissipating blood stasis, and the effect of sample DY was slightly poorer than DC. The orders of contribution of herb pairs containing Danggui on the formula were Danggui-Yimucao>Danggui-Chuanxiong>Danggui-Honghua>Danggui-Zhigancao>Danggui-Taoren>Danggui-Jiangtan. In conclusion, various herb pairs containing Danggui played different roles on the effects of improving the abnormality of hemorheology and coagulation function. And the herb pairs Danggui-Yimucao were particularly important for the formula, which was consistent with the characteristics of XSHG and the traditional effect of Yimucao. Moreover, it could lay foundation to further reveal the compatibility mechanism of XSHG.",

            "content": "At present, a variety of vaccines have been approved, and existing antiviral drugs are being tested to find an effective treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, no standardized treatment has yet been approved by the World Health Organization. The virally encoded chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which facilitates the replication of SARS-CoV in the host cells, is one potential pharmacological target for the development of anti-SARS drugs. Online search engines, such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus and PubMed, were used to retrieve data on the traditional uses of medicinal plants and their inhibitory effects against the SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Various pure compounds, including polyphenols, terpenoids, chalcones, alkaloids, biflavonoids, flavanones, anthraquinones and glycosides, have shown potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 2-44 µg/mL. Interestingly, most of these active compounds, including xanthoangelol E (isolated from Angelica keiskei), dieckol 1 (isolated from Ecklonia cava), amentoflavone (isolated from Torreya nucifera), celastrol, pristimerin, tingenone and iguesterin (isolated from Tripterygium regelii), tannic acid (isolated from Camellia sinensis), and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate, 3-isotheaflav1in-3 gallate and dihydrotanshinone I (isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza), had IC50 values of less than 15 µg/mL. Kinetic mechanistic studies of several active compounds revealed that their mode of inhibition was dose-dependent and competitive, with Ki values ranging from 2.4-43.8 μmol/L. Given the significance of plant-based compounds and the many promising results obtained, there is still need to explore the phytochemical and mechanistic potentials of plants and their products. These medicinal plants could serve as an effective inexpensive nutraceutical for the general public to help manage COVID-19.",

In present study, global metabolic profiling with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS) combined with pattern recognition method was performed to discover the underlying hematopoietic regulation mechanisms of DG, CX and GX on hemolytic and aplastic anemia rats (HAA) induced by acetyl phenylhydrazine (APH) and cyclophosphamide (CP). Thirteen endogenous metabolites contributing to the separation of model group and control group were tentatively identified. The levels of LPCs including lysoPC (18:0), lysoPC (20:4), lysoPC (16:0) and lysoPC (18:2), sphinganine, nicotinic acid, thiamine pyrophosphate, phytosphingosine, and glycerophosphocholine increased significantly (p<0.05) in HAA, while the levels of oleic acid, 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid, ceramides (d18:1/14:0), and 17a-hydroxypregnenolone decreased significantly (p<0.05) in comparison with control rats. Those endogenous metabolites were chiefly involved in thiamine metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism. The metabolic deviations could be regulated closer to normal level after DG, CX and GX intervention. In term of hematopoietic function, GX was the most effective as shown by the relative distance in PLS-DA score plots and relative intensity of metabolomic strategy, reflecting the synergic action between DG and CX. The relative distance calculation was firstly used in metabolomics for semi-quantization.",
